            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The EpiÅ¿tle to the READER.</head>
            <p>THIS following Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is a Theme Å¿o Å¿adly copious, that if thou art a true ProteÅ¿tant, thou canÅ¿t not but bewail the Å¿ad fate of many thouÅ¿and innocent ChriÅ¿tians whoÅ¿e Å¿ufferings, and their enemies cruelty Å¿trove for preheminence, who died not Å¿o much like Martyrs, as murthered like Å¿heep; being not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by force, but betrayed by Treachery, and perjury. Who can but from the depth of Å¿adneÅ¿s turn his Å¿orrow into tears, forcing open the bowels of his compaÅ¿sion, through
<pb facs="tcp:170274:7"/>the flood-gates of his eyes; when we Å¿hall conÅ¿ider, Å¿o many Lords and Gallant Commanders breath their laÅ¿t, by an ignominous and baÅ¿e death, not to be compared for cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perjury and treachery, in any age or HiÅ¿tory; for indeed theÅ¿e Å¿ad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities challenge the Tribute of a bleeding heart; Å¿o that if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders underÅ¿tanding be not already garriÅ¿oned with prejudice, or if the times be but patient of hearing truth this Book may prove of Å¿ome uÅ¿e to this Nation.</p>
            <p>The ruins of Truth is often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velloped in the Å¿able clouds of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion. <hi>Nimium altercando amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur,</hi> Truth may be loÅ¿t in a crowd; therefore my induÅ¿try to preÅ¿erve an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, may Å¿tand as an argument againÅ¿t calumny; for each Book preÅ¿t into the world, is as a Bark at Sea; the firÅ¿t as Å¿ubject to cenÅ¿ure, as the laÅ¿t to Å¿torms; therfore I cannot but expect a Å¿hower of cenÅ¿ures; yet, as
<pb facs="tcp:170274:7"/>Mr. <hi>Feltham</hi> Å¿aies, <hi>It is the eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t part to cenÅ¿ure; and though men think thereby to be accounted wiÅ¿e, yet</hi> (Å¿ayes he) <hi>there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diÅ¿covers a Fool more;</hi> for he that knows leaÅ¿t cenÅ¿ures moÅ¿t; Ignorance gives diÅ¿paragement<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> a lowder tongue than knowledge; like Rats that love to eat Books they cannot read, and however I may Å¿uffer the venome of AÅ¿ps, which grow on Å¿ome mens tongues, yet have I done without crime, what I ought to do in conÅ¿cience; and the more impetuous the Å¿torms, and rapid torrents of calumny aÅ¿Å¿ault and beat upon my endeavours, the more Å¿hall I, like the Traveller in the Fable, hug my Å¿elf in the Cloak of my own Innocency and Integrity; that though the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of my Labour prove abortive to Å¿ome, yet Å¿hall I enjoy the fredom of my own deÅ¿ire, and reward my Å¿elf with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that the envious World can
<pb facs="tcp:170274:8"/>neither give, nor take from me.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to the World that Å¿omething of this nature is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, yet may I humbly and truly Å¿ay, is Å¿hort of this: for the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Structures and compoÅ¿ure of this Narrative, fetches his Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als from Å¿undry Authors, both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and Antient; and being cul'd from the Reliques of Antiquity, by a careful gleaning out of many into one, may therefore challenge the privilege to Å¿ay, that all others want Å¿omewhat of this; being an exact Epitomy of the moÅ¿t remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paÅ¿Å¿ages of the Civil Wars, during this Kings Reign; yet as Å¿uccinct as an orderly proceeding can admit. And Courteous Reader, that thou mayeÅ¿t be perÅ¿waded to go further then the Entrance, I do aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure thee, that the body of this HiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is collected from the beÅ¿t Writers of both Å¿ides, whoÅ¿e tinctures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection according to their ByaÅ¿Å¿es, is
<pb facs="tcp:170274:8"/>Å¿o ballanced, that the Narrative Å¿tands free from the prejudicate part of either, being as impartial as pen can collect from the Original of antient Records; and as well diÅ¿tanced from the gaÅ¿hes of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Pen, as the two Poles from one another, or the <hi>Antipodes</hi> from us. For I find what any ProteÅ¿tant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inÅ¿erts of the worÅ¿t part, is no leÅ¿s publiÅ¿hed, than known by the Catholicks themÅ¿elves, for they cannot deny the act, only they excuÅ¿e the manner. And this advantage will come by this collection, that whereas it was in large volumes, now it is reduced and fitted to the time, and purÅ¿es of thoÅ¿e that had no occaÅ¿ion, and leÅ¿s abilities to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿h the peruÅ¿al or purchaÅ¿ing of large <hi>Folio's,</hi> which I think was the grand reaÅ¿on of Å¿tifling the knowledge hereof to many of this age.</p>
            <p>Reader, thou art here preÅ¿ented
<pb facs="tcp:170274:9"/>with the moÅ¿t horrid Rapes, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Perjury, and Treacherous Cruelty of a Prince and Court, that ever landed on <hi>European</hi> Å¿hore, for in few daies all the ProteÅ¿tant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, with Ladies and innocent Gentlewomen and children to the number of fourty thouÅ¿and, were inhumanely butchered, and cut off by the Kings Å¿pecial Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here thou mayeÅ¿t Å¿ee a Prince beÅ¿mearing himÅ¿elf with the Goar blood of his own Subjects, and at laÅ¿t wallowing in his own; we Å¿hall here Å¿ee Religious Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es, no Å¿tronger ties to the King, and Court, than a Rope of Å¿and to a wild beaÅ¿t; being gone Å¿o far in perjury, that the Kings faith was accounted like the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoÅ¿e unfaithfulneÅ¿s to their promiÅ¿es, is become Proverbial, that when one would expreÅ¿s perjury, they term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it <hi>Greca fides,</hi> for though a Creditor had ten bonds, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>Now the right uÅ¿e of theÅ¿e Å¿ad and Å¿udden murthers Å¿hould be to learn us the neceÅ¿sity of being ready prepared for Å¿uch violent deaths, and that proÅ¿perity is as diet to us, AdverÅ¿ity as PhyÅ¿ick, reducing to a right taÅ¿t of theÅ¿e mortal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; How happy will the Torments of cruelty be, when our cyes are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith on an Eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, linking our Å¿elves in that golden Chain of Salvation, which

How can a ChriÅ¿tians Judgement but be at nonage, when he values not the true worth of CeleÅ¿tials, but puts them in the ballance with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene things; He indeed hath found the PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿tone, that can turn all events into a Subjection to Gods Will.

               <p>The Admirall receiving this meÅ¿Å¿age was wonderfully put to underÅ¿tand what to do or Å¿ay, for although he Å¿eemed not to Å¿uÅ¿pect the Kings fidelity, yet he Å¿aw Å¿trong reaÅ¿ons to look about him, for though he valewed not his own life, yet he drew along with him the wellfare of all ProteÅ¿tants, therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered thus with himÅ¿elf.</p>

               <p>The Admirall could not but take notice, that at the Å¿ame time the EmbaÅ¿Å¿adour of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was admitted into the Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>France,</hi> (which to forein nations Å¿eemed utterly incredible) and that alÅ¿o one <hi>Brirragio</hi> a <hi>Lumbard</hi> (reported a traitor to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) being ignorant of the Law, was for his Å¿ubtil wit hoyÅ¿ted to the honourable office of Chancellour, in the room of <hi>Michael HoÅ¿pitall</hi> diÅ¿placed, a man well known to be a true Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot to his own Country, and alÅ¿o Å¿o, learned and able, as the like could never be found in <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>This young Gentleman by his great inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with the Duke, grew alÅ¿o into high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King and Queen Mother, and for his wit and carriage, drew the eyes of all the Court towards him; attracting great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teem from King, Queen Mother, and Court. This unfortunate Gentleman, more happy in the imployment, than wiÅ¿e in the improvement of his parts; who being in the high Road of Honour, wanted but few Å¿teps to a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, which time, and his wiÅ¿e mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would neceÅ¿Å¿arily have courted him with, and conferred on him, This Gentleman (I Å¿ay) hapned by his great eÅ¿teem to be admitted to the preÅ¿ence of the King and Nobles; and once on a time when many Nobles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were preÅ¿ent with his MajeÅ¿ty, through Å¿ome occaÅ¿ion of a Treaty for a peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of freedom of Religion according to the Edict.</p>
               <p>At this time the King was highly moved with the ProteÅ¿tant Nobility; this young Gentleman, Å¿eeing the King angry, preÅ¿ently Å¿tepped to the King, and whether to pleaÅ¿e the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170274:74"/>King, or to let his MajeÅ¿tie know he was thought worthy of counÅ¿el, by the great truÅ¿t Å¿ome had put him in, or moved by ambition to appear no Å¿tranger to the Kings neareÅ¿t Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creÅ¿ies, which Å¿ometimes in young wits many times runs before a diÅ¿creet conduct of their advantages; But he (I Å¿ay) whiÅ¿pers in the Kings ear, <hi>DeÅ¿iring his MajeÅ¿ty that he would pleaÅ¿e to Å¿ilence his mind, with a patient forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of anger, and to Å¿mile away their inÅ¿olency and folly, for his MajeÅ¿ty well knew that few days would ripen their deÅ¿truction, and lay them level to juÅ¿tice, which Å¿aies he, by a Å¿ecret policy of your MajeÅ¿ties great WiÅ¿dom and compleat contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, was almoÅ¿t brought to a full concluÅ¿ion laÅ¿t meeting; and which no doubt in the end will Å¿peedily, and Å¿ecurely, render your MajeÅ¿ty in a full and ample capacity to be avenged on their haughtineÅ¿s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King at theÅ¿e words Å¿tartled within himÅ¿elf, being touched at the quick to have Å¿uch a Å¿ecret imparted to one that was not of the conÅ¿piracy, whoÅ¿e raw retention might prove fatal to them all; wondering how, and by what means, he Å¿hould come to the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Now the King in whom lodged a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge beyond his years, diÅ¿Å¿embled his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding at this time, and made no Å¿hew of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that might tend to the underÅ¿tanding of his Å¿peech; but Å¿peedily retired to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with a mind full of anxity and fury, and preÅ¿ently without any delayes examines the <hi>Count de Retz,</hi> who denies that ever he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing to any or to him; he then char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Queen Mother, who anÅ¿wered Å¿he was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170274:74"/>not to learn of him to keep Å¿ecrets; at laÅ¿t he fell to examine the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed it, and fell to perÅ¿wade the King, that it was as Å¿ecurely locked from any further diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as in his own breaÅ¿t; and like a Spring lock would Å¿hut but not open of it Å¿elf; That his MajeÅ¿ty need not fear that any Å¿ecret impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Ligneroles</hi> Å¿hould ever come neerer his mouth than his heart; the King anÅ¿wers, <hi>No more it Å¿hall, and I wiÅ¿h it had never come there, for I Å¿hall take order that he Å¿hall not have time to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the King calls <hi>George de Villequier, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of <hi>Guerchy</hi> (whom his MajeÅ¿tie knew ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ligneroles</hi> perfectly) and commanded him to uÅ¿e his DiÅ¿cretion for a Å¿peedy removal of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> out of this world, and to put off the effecting his deÅ¿ire no longer, and that day to bring to paÅ¿s his pleaÅ¿ure, and command, without fear or delay, which with the AÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of another, was accordingly done; as Å¿oon as the King heard hereof, he was Å¿eeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry, and commanded the <hi>Vicount,</hi> and <hi>Count Charls</hi> his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant, to be impriÅ¿oned in the Palace, but in a Months time, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of <hi>MonÅ¿ieur de AngoleÅ¿m,</hi> as alÅ¿o by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace and favour, they were Å¿et at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

               <p>One of theÅ¿e villains Å¿natching up a Little child in his arms, the child began to play with his beard, but inÅ¿tead of compaÅ¿Å¿ion this baÅ¿e murtherer had Å¿uch a flinty heart, that he wounded it with his dagger, and Å¿o caÅ¿t it in a goar blood into the River.</p>

               <p>The Governour being refuÅ¿ed by a conÅ¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Hangman, and honourable Souldiers, more fit for <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>CaeÅ¿ar</hi> than this bloody and cruel Tyrant; he I Å¿ay rather than let the command of a King ly dead, gathers together the Å¿cum of wicked men, and Å¿pawn
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170274:103"/>of the Devil, the legitimate of-Å¿pring of a HelliÅ¿h brood, the Watermen, and bloody Butchers, who being let into priÅ¿on with their bloody Knives and inÅ¿truments, (oh unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful wretches!) Å¿uch as they find proÅ¿trate at their feet, holding forth their petitions in their Å¿ad requeÅ¿ts in a bleating Oratory, crying to Gods mercy and mans pitty.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e Butchers of innocent Å¿ouls, inÅ¿tead of pitty, for Å¿port cut of their fingers, and tops of their noÅ¿es, and then fell a murthering; throughout the City was Å¿uch doleful noiÅ¿e of the dying, and lamentable howling of women and children, that all thoÅ¿e that were zealous in the RomiÅ¿h Religion, abhorred their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, and had their hearts Å¿o peirced with the Å¿ad groans of the dying, that they thought they were devils that onely had human Å¿hape, or that they were Indian Tygars, or wild beaÅ¿ts only had aÅ¿Å¿umed the Å¿hape of men; nay many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the PopiÅ¿h Religion that were with child, and now nigh their time of Delivery, were Å¿o affrighted with theÅ¿e Å¿ad cruelties, that they parted with child; The murthers and maÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿acre was Å¿o great that out of one of the priÅ¿ons called the Arch-biÅ¿hops houÅ¿e, the blood of the Å¿lain was Å¿een running down the Å¿treets in the day time, in great abundance to the aÅ¿toniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horrour of all the Beholders, for it run warm and Å¿moaking hot through the Å¿treets and Å¿o into the River.</p>
               <p>AmongÅ¿t them that were butchered in this PriÅ¿on, was an antient man, named <hi>Francis de BoÅ¿Å¿u,</hi> a Merchant that had to his Sons two Religious young-men, whom he had carefully trained up in the fear of the Lord: As Å¿oon
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170274:103"/>as the Murtherers approached with their Axes, he exhorted his Sons, Not to fear death, for it was but a quick paÅ¿Å¿age to their Fathers houÅ¿e, for that through many tribulations we muÅ¿t enter into the Kingdome of God; for it has alwaies been, and will be to the end of the World, the lot of all Gods people to be as Å¿heep among wolves; if we Å¿uffer with ChriÅ¿t we Å¿hall alÅ¿o reign with him, this Å¿hort cut of ours will be, but as a Bridge for our more Å¿pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paÅ¿Å¿age to eternal life; let us joyfully follow this company that is gone before us; and Å¿o the old ChriÅ¿tian and aged Father imbraced his two young Sons, and they him, with mutual embraces, and held Å¿o faÅ¿t together, that with the Murtherers blows they fell all flat to the ground together, crying to the mercy of God, and thus with many wounds was the godly Soul, and his two Sons cruelly murthered, by theÅ¿e bloody Butchers, and which is not to be forgotten, TheÅ¿e three bodies along time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were wonderfully knit together, which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Å¿ad Å¿ight to the Spectators.</p>
               <p>After all theÅ¿e cruelties were done, <hi>Mandelot</hi> the Governonr commanded to be proclamed, that no man Å¿hould commit any more mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that if any one would diÅ¿cover any of the actors of Å¿uch horrid villainyes, they Å¿hould be rewarded with a hundred Crowns for their information; but alas, this was in a baÅ¿e, Å¿cornful and diÅ¿dainful way, for from that time they ceaÅ¿ed not to kill and murder all they knew had eÅ¿caped the common deÅ¿tiny, and on Sabbath day morning thoÅ¿e poor ProteÅ¿tants that had eÅ¿caped their fury, was now by order of this baÅ¿e and bloody <hi>Mandelot,</hi> deÅ¿troied and hewen in pieces.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:170274:104"/>
               <p>TheÅ¿e bloody Villains paÅ¿Å¿ing through the Streets with their bloody InÅ¿truments, boaÅ¿ted that they had died their white Doublets with the blood of the ProteÅ¿tants, one bragging that he had killed an hundred, Å¿ome more, Å¿ome leÅ¿s: On the firÅ¿t of <hi>September</hi> their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were ordered to be thrown into the River, but a great part of them <hi>Mandelot</hi> ordered to be boated over to the other Å¿ide of the River, and laid on a green bank, neer to an Abby na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>EÅ¿ne;</hi> and there the people came and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed their bodies: and one thing (for the like was never heard of) is not here to be omitted; The Apothecaries viewing the bodies Å¿aid, they uÅ¿ed to make medicines of mens greaÅ¿e; and being there were many fat bodies, there might be monies got, and Å¿o wiÅ¿hed the Butchers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them their greaÅ¿e, and they Å¿hould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, the bloody fellows Å¿peedily chooÅ¿e out the fatteÅ¿t, launched them with their bloody Knives, and Å¿old their fat for three Å¿hillings a pound. So at laÅ¿t their bodies were Å¿ome thrown into a great pit, the reÅ¿t into the River.</p>
               <p>The people inhabiting on the borders of the River, admired to Å¿ee Å¿o many dead carcaÅ¿Å¿es come down, having their bodies baÅ¿ely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, Å¿ome with eyes out, others their noÅ¿es, hands and ears cut off, and Å¿tabb'd in every part of their bodies.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Popes Legat arrived at <hi>Lyons,</hi> who coming out of the great Church from MaÅ¿s, the bloody Murtherers of Å¿o many innocent ChriÅ¿tians kneel down before him for abÅ¿olution, and as Å¿oon as the Legat was told who they were, and for what they kneeled

               <p>The Kings Letters and commands coming to <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿et</hi> the Kings Atturney at <hi>Meaux;</hi> he forthwith ordered thoÅ¿e of his bloody crew to come to him, who accordingly at Å¿even a clock at night came, and received Orders to Å¿hut up the City Gates; at which time alÅ¿o they went through the Town doing nothing all that night but murther, kill and diÅ¿troy the poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants; in the morning they apprehended two hundred, and committed them to priÅ¿ons; <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿et</hi> comes to them, and having a Catalogue of their names, he calls them out one by one, and baÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthers as many as they could, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary they went to Å¿upper, and after a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freÅ¿hment they returned again, and now they brought quicker InÅ¿truments of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Axes, and Å¿o fell again to call them out by their names, and butchered them moÅ¿t cruelly, amongÅ¿t whom was a godly Elder of a Church, who praying for his Enemies, they reviled him, and having on a buff Coat, they fearing it Å¿hould be Å¿poiled with blood, did open it before and Å¿tabb'd him in the breaÅ¿t, whereof he died. AmongÅ¿t theÅ¿e alÅ¿o thus Å¿lain was an antient Gentleman Sheriff of the City, whom they cruelly handled, for firÅ¿t they cut off his noÅ¿e, and privy members, then thruÅ¿t him often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, toÅ¿Å¿ing him up and down, that at laÅ¿t he fell down dead, crying out to God for mercy.</p>
               <p>As Å¿oon as the Å¿peedy poÅ¿t with the Kings Letters came to <hi>Troyes,</hi> the poor ProteÅ¿tants
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170274:105"/>were quickly impriÅ¿oned, the Bayliff Summons the Keeper of the PriÅ¿on, who being Å¿ick Å¿ent one <hi>Martin</hi> to know his pleaÅ¿ure, the Bayliff told him all their PriÅ¿oners muÅ¿t be Å¿lain; and Å¿o commanded a pit to be digged in the PriÅ¿on that the blood might not run down the Streets, now the Jaylor and his bloody aÅ¿Å¿ociates going to murther theÅ¿e poor innocent Å¿ouls, no Å¿oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Å¿aw them, but their conÅ¿ciences gave back, Å¿tanding amazed at the horridneÅ¿s of their task, and Å¿o return, but the Bayliff got them, and filled them Å¿o full of wine and Å¿trong drink, that without any fear or danger they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and called them forth by their names, he that came out firÅ¿t had a chearful countenance, and calling on the name of the Lord he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his BreaÅ¿t and was killed preÅ¿ently; the next that came, being Å¿everal times wounded with a Halberd, and not killed, did at laÅ¿t cheerfully take the Halberd by the point, and put it to his breaÅ¿t, Å¿aying, <hi>Here bloody Murtherer, here, right at the heart, right at the heart,</hi> and Å¿o was thruÅ¿t through and died. All the reÅ¿t were cruelly murthered, and caÅ¿t into a great pit on the back of the PriÅ¿on; and although Å¿ome were not quite dead, yet they caÅ¿t them in, one of theÅ¿e poor Souls having more life than the reÅ¿t, roÅ¿e up in the pit above his Fellows, but was preÅ¿ently Å¿mothered with Earth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was a pit digged in the PriÅ¿on to Å¿ave the blood, yet Å¿uch was the effuÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿tian blood, that it run out of priÅ¿on Å¿trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down the Gutters of the Å¿treets, to the amazement of the PopiÅ¿h Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But now at <hi>Orleance,</hi> the place of the laÅ¿t Treaty of peace, and the place where it was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170274:105"/>Å¿olemnly proclaimed with full command for ObÅ¿ervation of the Edict. At this place, I Å¿ay, the Kings Letters came, commanding to murther all, and happened to come the Å¿ame day that three hundred were met together at a Sermon, whereupon the Maior and Officers commanded the Companies in arms to fall on, and to execute Å¿peedily the Kings command, oh Tyrant, and bloody command! One of the Murtherers went to a noble mans houÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting himÅ¿elf, and his bloody followers to Supper, where they were made welcome with good chear, no Å¿ooner was Supper ended, but they blaÅ¿pheming murthered him, and all his family, and then plundered his houÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>There were many that lived on the outÅ¿ide of the Town, amongÅ¿t whom was heard Å¿uch Å¿ad murtherings, and cruelties, that all night long was heard nothing but howlings and cryings of men, women and children maÅ¿Å¿acred, Å¿hooting off of Guns, and PiÅ¿tols, breaking doors, and rumbling of Carts that conveyed away the dead bodies, all which were mixed with the cryes of the bloody Murtherers, crying Kill, Kill them all, and then take the Spoil; and thus they continued all the week in theÅ¿e Å¿ad and bloody murthers, and plundering, blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouÅ¿ly Å¿inging in Å¿corn, where is now their God.</p>
               <p>On TueÅ¿day they came to a Doctor of the Civil Law, who being found in earneÅ¿t pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, they had not the power to kill him, only took a little plunder with them, next day they came again, and views his Library, what books they demanded he gave them, they told him he muÅ¿t be killed, he therefore goes to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170274:106"/>again, and afterwards deÅ¿ired of them that if he muÅ¿t dy to murther him there, which they refuÅ¿ed, they take him and lead him through the Streets, and coming to the Schools he deÅ¿ired them to kill him where he taught Å¿o many; but they led him a little further, and Å¿o knocked him on the head. One that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by hunger out of a Å¿ecret place where he hid himÅ¿elf, was preÅ¿ently Å¿lain. Such as for fear revolted, they forced to kill their friends or were killed themÅ¿elves.</p>
               <p>As Å¿oon as the Kings bloody MeÅ¿Å¿age came to the City of <hi>TholouÅ¿e,</hi> the Gates were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently Å¿hut, but it pleaÅ¿ed the Lord of his good grace and Providence Å¿o to order it, that the ProteÅ¿tants were gone that morning out of the Ciry to a Sermon, and as Å¿oon as the noiÅ¿e of the MaÅ¿Å¿acre came to their ears, many returned not again to the City! But others would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Å¿o far as to go to order their affairs for a Return, but poor Å¿ouls they never returned back, for as Å¿oon as they came to the Gates they were Å¿uffered to enter, leaving their Å¿words at the Gates, amongÅ¿t whom was many of great account, and on wedneÅ¿day morning all the poor ProteÅ¿tants were impriÅ¿oned, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that none Å¿hould on pain of death hide any of them.</p>
               <p>AmongÅ¿t theÅ¿e were Å¿ix CounÅ¿ellers; which like good ChriÅ¿tians encouraged the reÅ¿t: at laÅ¿t they were all brought into one place, and Å¿o the bloody Murtherers being ready with axes and knives they were one by one deÅ¿troyed, their bodies Å¿tripped naked, and lay for two daies; The Å¿ix CounÅ¿ellours being hung up in their long Gowns upon Elm Trees in the Palace
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170274:106"/>yard; which would move any one to compaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion there being in this City three hundred thus murthered.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Roan</hi> as Å¿oon as the Kings command came, there was an infinite number Å¿lain in few daies, Å¿ix thouÅ¿and men beÅ¿ides women, whom they uÅ¿ed as cruelly as can be imagined, their bodies were Å¿tript and caried out in carts, being put into the pits in great heaps.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as Å¿oon as the news of the MaÅ¿Å¿acre at <hi>Paris</hi> arrived, and command from the King to follow their Example. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants were boating over the River to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but orders followed them that they Å¿hould be apprehended, whereupon the Gates of the City were Å¿hut, yet the MiniÅ¿ters through Gods good mercy and grace eÅ¿caped, and Å¿afely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>England.</hi> The Governour was Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what timerous to act the Kings command in Å¿uch a bloody Å¿ubjection to cruelty, but the Lord <hi>MonpeÅ¿Å¿at</hi> aÅ¿Å¿ured him, how acceptable it would be to his MajeÅ¿ty, and for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement he enters the houÅ¿e of the Lord of <hi>Obiers,</hi> and baÅ¿ely murthered him in his own Court.</p>
               <p>And then preÅ¿ently the froath and Scum of the Town, aÅ¿Å¿embled and murthered all the reÅ¿t, amongÅ¿t whom was a MiniÅ¿ter that came out of the adjacent Countrey, AlÅ¿o there was a reverend old Deacon of a church whom they dragged out of his Å¿ick bed through the Streets, and Å¿o baÅ¿ely and inhumanly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>As Å¿oon as the bloody MeÅ¿Å¿age of the Kings cruell command arrives at <hi>Angiers,</hi> they fell on all the ProteÅ¿tants without mercy or pitty,

               <p>And Å¿o this faithful Servant of ChriÅ¿t fell dead at his feet.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOw when all was murthered that could very well be laid hands on, and the King underÅ¿tanding that divers ProteÅ¿tants, had in many parts of the Kingdom fled, and left their Habitations for Å¿ecurity of their Lives; He
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170274:109"/>acts the Å¿econd and worÅ¿t part of his DeviliÅ¿h Treachery and cruelty; for after many Å¿weet baits of inticing and alluring promiÅ¿es for them to come in, he at laÅ¿t publiÅ¿hed Letters, and Å¿ent MeÅ¿Å¿engers;</p>
               <p>Wherein he Å¿hewed, The great grief it was to him that Å¿o much blood Å¿hould be Å¿pilt in the Nation, contrary to his will, promiÅ¿ing to puniÅ¿h the Actors of Å¿uch horrid villainies, with as much crueltie as JuÅ¿tice could inflict, and they deÅ¿erve.

               <p>Now many poor ProteÅ¿tants that had left all, and fled into the woods, being encouraged by theÅ¿e inticing and fair pretexts, returned home, eÅ¿pecially they that had fled from <hi>Diep, Roan,</hi> and <hi>TholouÅ¿e;</hi> now we Å¿hall Å¿ee the King like a Thorny BuÅ¿h to the poor Å¿heep, that in a Å¿torm they run to Å¿helter, and inÅ¿tead thereof are intangled, and their wool pull'd off their backs. But oh wretched Tyrant, and worÅ¿e King! whoÅ¿e furious and bloody mind, like an impetuous Whirlewind, or Hiricane, could not be kept in bounds, but ere two daies paÅ¿t he impriÅ¿ons them all, and appoints baÅ¿e fellowes to murther them, with cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>Now at the Å¿ame time, were Orders given
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170274:112"/>out by the King, for all Towns and Provinces within his Power, to follow the example of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and to murther and put to death all of the Religion, and the very next month he wholly aboliÅ¿hes that famous Edict, giving command to root out all the ProteÅ¿tants both from EÅ¿tates and Places, and at laÅ¿t as we Å¿hall Å¿ee, cauÅ¿es a Form of Abjuration to be made, and cauÅ¿ing it to de proclaimed, That no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Å¿hould be exerciÅ¿ed in the Kingdom but the <hi>RomiÅ¿h.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we Å¿ee by theÅ¿e Letters that the King would fain lay the blot of this foul crueltie to the antient Quarrel of the houÅ¿es of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>ChaÅ¿tillon,</hi> therefore the <hi>GuiÅ¿ans</hi> foreÅ¿eeing the foulneÅ¿s of the fact, Å¿trove as much to evade the dint of the DiÅ¿honour, as the King did, though the <hi>GuiÅ¿ans</hi> were the Plotters and chief Agents in the practical part of this cruel Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy; whereupon they handled the matter Å¿o, that the King was forced to acknowledge, and avow publickly this horrid act, and indeed none more fit than the King that commanded it. And truly the Å¿ad effects of theÅ¿e unheard-of cruelties, would make any one diÅ¿own it, and gladly would the King don Å¿o, for he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the effects, and now could neither evade the diÅ¿honour, nor Gods juÅ¿t Judgements. But he is not yet ripe for them; although in theÅ¿e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maÅ¿Å¿acres he had not Å¿pared, but baÅ¿ely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed to be butchered, an infinite number of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Noblemen, and Young Ladies, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of learned men, many reverend old men, many young Gentlewomen and Virgins, many honourable Matrons of good account, women with child, and little infants at their mothers breaÅ¿ts.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170274:112"/>
               <p>Now the King being forced, to let the world know his perjury, and cruelty, he labours to Å¿et a good face on his cruel heart, Å¿o that the King that had the four and twentieth day of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> 1572. declared by Letters to all the Provinces and Å¿everal Princes abroad, that the tumult in <hi>Paris,</hi> aroÅ¿e betwixt the two parties of the <hi>GuiÅ¿an</hi> and Admiral; now but two dayes after, being the twenty Å¿ixth of the Å¿ame mouth, This moÅ¿t mighty King (and by conÅ¿ent of all nations commonly called) the moÅ¿t Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian King, comes into the Parliament, with a great Train of his Brethren, and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of his Court attending him, where in a full AÅ¿Å¿embly of his Council, he aÅ¿cends the Throne, and Å¿itting thereon, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects his Speech to this great AÅ¿Å¿embly in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings Speech in Parlament</note>That having been informed, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral with certain of his confederates, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding all his favors, &amp; gratious pardons granted to their former Rebellions, yet have now plotted againÅ¿t my perÅ¿on, with my mother and Brethren, to our utter perdition, which being diÅ¿covered, I was forced to prevent my own ruin, by JuÅ¿tice to procure theirs, and by a Å¿peedy courÅ¿e, have heaped on their own heads what they would have heaped on mine. For this cauÅ¿e therefore it was, that by my command the Admiral and his Complices, are deÅ¿ervedly cut off, hoping thereby, that a period is not only put to their TreaÅ¿on againÅ¿t my Å¿elf, and Nobles, but alÅ¿o to future troubles, which would have fallen on this poor Nation, to an utter ruin thereof.</p>
               <p>Now although at firÅ¿t, he had both by words
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170274:113"/>and Letters, laid the whole BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s on the fury of a popular tumult, headed by the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>GuiÅ¿ans,</hi> yet now at this time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking his DeÅ¿ign, he diÅ¿covers himÅ¿elf like his actions, and now laid down his ReaÅ¿ons and grounds of this manner of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t theÅ¿e Rebells, as he calls them; and Å¿o further declared,</p>
               <p>That he thought it not altogether unfit to make his MagiÅ¿trates acquainted with it, That what was done at <hi>Paris</hi> in the late Slaughters, was by his own commandment, for the Å¿afety of his own life, and national tranquillity, and alÅ¿o that they might proceed with the like Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, againÅ¿t Å¿uch Traytors, and Rebells of Å¿uch a wicked ConÅ¿piracy, and that it was a Å¿udden thing, and not premeditated (a deep reach to take off the edge of Å¿uÅ¿pition) hapning in a manner, Å¿aies he, by chance, and not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plotted contrivance.</p>
               <p>This Speech of the Kings, was by himÅ¿elf, and the Parliament commanded to be written, and entered into the Records of Parliament, proclaimed by Heraulds, and publiÅ¿hed in print, a Book alÅ¿o was publiÅ¿hed by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (which becauÅ¿e it is within four daies of the Å¿ame date of that Letter, wherein he laies the blame of the Admirals death, &amp;c. on the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e,</hi> and here takes it to himÅ¿elf) therefore I Å¿ay I thought fit to inÅ¿ert that printed Book by way of Declaration, which is as followeth.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170274:115"/>to be notable for his light brain and cruel heart, who truÅ¿ting more to a Å¿lipery tongue, than a Å¿ound cauÅ¿e, congratulated the King for his wiÅ¿e Policy and good Å¿ucceÅ¿s in a Å¿peedy conqueÅ¿t over his Enemies.</p>
               <p>But alas! how did he conquer? Only by wearing the veÅ¿t of the Innocent, to conceal and cover the deformed uglineÅ¿s of his perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perjury.</p>
               <p>But the Advocate of the <hi>Finanees</hi> Å¿uccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered his mind to this purpoÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>That though his MajeÅ¿ty had juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to puniÅ¿h Delinquents, yet it were more becoming the juÅ¿tice of a Prince, to proceed according to the Lawes by himÅ¿elf decreed and eÅ¿tabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed, and Å¿o more fit for his MajeÅ¿ty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Å¿peedy ceÅ¿Å¿ation of Å¿uch violent Å¿laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to enter upon a judicial proceeding, according to the Laws, which was well known to be the proper and peaceable eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of Empires and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>This advice takes well, for now the King begins to do unjuÅ¿tly in the name of JuÅ¿tice; Å¿o he proceeds to diÅ¿Å¿emble a Legality for all his future Butcheries, unwilling to murther any more without a Å¿tatute, and pretence of JuÅ¿tice for it.</p>
               <p>This being a brave principle of a Tyrant; and that whereas the Laws at firÅ¿t were known to be the legitimate daughter of judgement, it muÅ¿t now be made the adopted daughter of Tyranny.</p>

               <p>And now the King begins to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the adviÅ¿e of the Advocate; being alÅ¿o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded to it by <hi>Morvilleir,</hi> a wicked fellow, and the firÅ¿t that brought the PrieÅ¿ts into the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> now it was thought fit to bring to publick JuÅ¿tice, thoÅ¿e that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken flying and hiding themÅ¿elves, and Å¿o after the uÅ¿ual manner of Judicial proceedings, Å¿hould be examined by choÅ¿en Judges cull'd on purpoÅ¿e, and Å¿o by Sentence condemned, that in view of all the world, they might receive their execution as the effects of juÅ¿tice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of there TreaÅ¿onous practices.</p>
               <p>The Judges thus appointed, was <hi>Birage, Thuan, Limege</hi> and <hi>Belleuxe;</hi> who preÅ¿ently gave order for a man of Hay made in Å¿hape of

               <p>But God uÅ¿ed theÅ¿e things afterwards as a further mean to diÅ¿cover their treachery, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170274:116"/>Å¿o proved againÅ¿t their expected advantage.</p>
               <p>For had the King and Court of <hi>France</hi> declared at firÅ¿t that they deÅ¿igned to cut of their Enemies, as the exuberous branches of the Kings indulgency, and now grown his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hy their plotted treachery, this would have excuÅ¿ed them from perjury and treaÅ¿on, but to pretend that they intended not what they really reÅ¿olved to do, and nothing leÅ¿s than what they did, This I Å¿ay was the height of diÅ¿honour to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus died that famous, Religious, and Noble Commander <hi>GaÅ¿per de Colligny</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the ProteÅ¿tant Army and cauÅ¿e, for the Å¿pace of twelve years; whoÅ¿e deÅ¿erved Fame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with great renown in the hearts of all the Godly, and with no leÅ¿s terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often filled the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> whoÅ¿e valour purchaÅ¿ed great merit from his Enemies; He that made the King and Court afraid, in a haÅ¿ty and diÅ¿orderly retreat from <hi>Meaux</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> And that I may add one mite to the TreaÅ¿ure of his true worth, this is he that many praiÅ¿ed and all admired, that through a wiÅ¿e conduct of his affairs, terrified his boiÅ¿terous Enemyes, to a Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ive calm of Å¿ubjection; A man Å¿o inÅ¿pired with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and conÅ¿tancy, that to take a DeÅ¿cription by any pen, would be the higheÅ¿t road to lay his merits in the grave of obÅ¿curity, being a man full of the Å¿ail of valour and Å¿ound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Å¿tar of the greateÅ¿t magnitude in the affairs of higheÅ¿t importance, Å¿hining for ever in the loweÅ¿t obÅ¿curity of diÅ¿cords, Å¿udden dangers, and inÅ¿urrections. One that cannot be enough admired, commended or honoured,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170274:117"/>being above all a man of profound judgement in point of reality. This being the leaÅ¿t part of honour that is paid to his eternal worth by all that knew him. He, he it was that baÅ¿ely Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the unreÅ¿iÅ¿table Å¿hock of a perfidious, and treacherous death, cowardly murthered by thoÅ¿e that durÅ¿t never draw a Sword with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olution of valour againÅ¿t this Champion, but trembled at his Remembrance and PreÅ¿ence, who was never overcome by valour but by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice.</p>
               <p>AmongÅ¿t the reÅ¿t that were brought to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal murder. was one named <hi>Caviagnes</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter of the RequeÅ¿ts to the King, and one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Briquemault,</hi> both inward friends to the Admiral, and in great reputation in the Court of honour and Camp of Chivalry.</p>
               <p>Now this brave Commander and old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Briquemault,</hi> having great renown by his Å¿ervice under King <hi>Francis,</hi> and King <hi>Henry,</hi> was therefore honoured by all but Å¿uch as love no Rivals, nor valued any crueltie if they could but out Å¿hine others loyalty, by their own treachery. This brave Gentleman was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourÅ¿core and ten years old, and poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had gone through too much proof of fidelity, now to end his life under the command and protection of Å¿uch a cruel Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Now theÅ¿e gallant Commanders aged with experience, and filled with innocent integrity, were like Lambs before Wolves, threatened to be torn in pieces unleÅ¿s without delay, they would with their own hands Å¿ubÅ¿cribe that they were of the Admirals Councel, to cut off the King, by an untimely death; together with the Queen his Mother and his Brethren,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170274:117"/>and promiÅ¿ing pardon, if they would accept of it; TheÅ¿e innocent Gentlemen cryed out, That they were ready to Å¿uffer the Torments of their mercileÅ¿s cruelty upon their bodies, rather than pull down vengeance upon their Å¿potleÅ¿s Å¿ouls, Å¿o humbly beÅ¿eeched the King to Å¿pare his torments, Å¿eeing none could peirce Å¿o far as force themÅ¿elves to a falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ation, yet if his MajeÅ¿ty pleaÅ¿ed to totment their bodies, they hoped God would Å¿o in his mercy order it, as to leÅ¿Å¿en the pain thereof by his gratious preÅ¿ence in their Å¿ouls; in whoÅ¿e goodneÅ¿s they hoped to depend for aid, rather than perjure their own Souls by a falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and others, being as full of innocency and integrity as they of cruelty and perjury; they were reÅ¿olved never to accuÅ¿e murthered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, wherein they never were guilty, nor commit Å¿uch an execrable crime as the King requeÅ¿ted; and (Å¿ay they) though the King va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues the tranquility of his Realm before the blood of ChriÅ¿tians; yet we hope to embrace a peaceable conÅ¿cience, in trampling underfoot the high eÅ¿teem of a tranÅ¿itory poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion; for what will it gain us to gain our lives and loÅ¿e our immortal Å¿ouls?</p>
               <p>The Judges having Å¿ome remorÅ¿e of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, began to deny the embracement of that infamy,<note place="margin">The Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges toucht in conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿e to fit in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which muÅ¿t juÅ¿tly fall on their unjuÅ¿t Sentence; for indeed their reaÅ¿ons were unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiÅ¿table; and theÅ¿e Judges underÅ¿tood the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the King by the Defendants Pleas, Å¿o they refuÅ¿ed any more to hear, or determine, much leÅ¿s to give Sentence, whereupon were new Judges appointed in their room, and to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170274:118"/>them was joined a Tormenter, and Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as might Å¿uit with them, Å¿o at laÅ¿t theÅ¿e eminent and brave Cammanders and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were by a Å¿hadow of Law, and illegal Legality, condemned to dy, and Å¿o the 22. of <hi>October</hi> 1572. in the fight of the King, Queen, Mother, her Sons, with many thouÅ¿and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on them, they were led to the gallows, Å¿eated in the prime Å¿treet of the City, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore execution, as <hi>Briquemault</hi> aÅ¿cended the Ladder, came to him the under ProvoÅ¿t of the Town, whom the King had commanded to inÅ¿inuate into him and to profer pardon for life, if he would confeÅ¿s what was laid to his charge, Å¿aying further, that his MajeÅ¿ty being of an eaÅ¿ie nature, and courteous affability, would as Å¿peedily grant pardon, as he ask it, but he, like one truer to his own Å¿oul, then the K. to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e, replyed, That it was the K. duty to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God, if the day of Gods mercy had not paÅ¿t upon his cruelty and perjury, and Å¿o was far from asking forgiveneÅ¿s for that, whereof God and his Å¿oul were witneÅ¿Å¿es of his innocency, yet to prove himÅ¿elf as good a ChriÅ¿tian as the King a ernel Tyrant, he cordially deÅ¿ired God of his great mercy to forgive the King. And Å¿o lifting up his eyes to heaven, he uttered theÅ¿e Words, Oh my God, upon whoÅ¿e Tribunal Å¿eat I Å¿tand, and whoÅ¿e face I hope Å¿hortly to Å¿ee, thou knoweÅ¿t well that I know nothing, nor did not Å¿o much as once think of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piracy againÅ¿t the King, nor againÅ¿t his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate; though I Å¿tand charged with the Å¿ame in my proceÅ¿s, but I beÅ¿eech God to pardon the King, and all thoÅ¿e that have been the cauÅ¿e of this my unjuÅ¿t death, even as I deÅ¿ire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170274:118"/>at thy hands for my Å¿ins, and offences committed againÅ¿t thy Divine MajeÅ¿ty; Å¿o aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending another Å¿tep of the Ladder, he onely Å¿aid, I have Å¿omwhat to utter to the King, which I would be glad to communicate unto him, but (Å¿aies he) I Å¿ee that I may not; and Å¿o Å¿hrunk up his Å¿houldiers, forbearing to uÅ¿e any further Å¿peech; Å¿o theÅ¿e two brave Gentlement were at laÅ¿t with halters about their necks, moÅ¿t baÅ¿ely, unjuÅ¿tly and diÅ¿honorably thrown off the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Hangman; whoÅ¿e deaths ere this are accounted for; and as <hi>Briquemaults</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tancy was much commended, Å¿o was his death much bewailed by many Catholicks, that were Å¿pectators of this Å¿ad crueltie.</p>
               <p>Two things was very ill Å¿poken of by the Catholicks and ProteÅ¿tants; firÅ¿t the preÅ¿ence of the King, as a thing unworthy the Head of JuÅ¿tice, to Å¿ee the Execution; Secondly, That <hi>Briquemault</hi> being a Gentleman of Good deÅ¿cent, was baÅ¿ely hanged, being a thing rare in <hi>France,</hi> but eÅ¿pecially now in regard he was reputed of his Enemies to be free from the charge for which he died; about an hour after this unheard-of JuÅ¿tice and execution the bloody Catholicks of <hi>Paris,</hi> drew their bodies through the Streets, thruÅ¿t their dead bodies through with daggers, Å¿hooting of dags at them, cutting off their ears, and omitted no other kind of cruelty, and barbarous villany that could be imagined.</p>
               <p>And thus the Noble Gantlemen, by their ChriÅ¿tian Moderation and compoÅ¿edneÅ¿s of mind, reared Trophies of Honour out of the Ruins of their own misfortunes, <hi>Et MiÅ¿erias infularum loco habuere,</hi> wore their diÅ¿aÅ¿ters like
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170274:119"/>holy veÅ¿tments as robes of honour, They let the world know they could not only do but Å¿uffer, and that paÅ¿Å¿ive fortitude is as good as active valour, <hi>Et facere &amp; pati fortia, hoc</hi> Romanum <hi>eÅ¿t, L. Flo.</hi>

And that the Å¿aid Sacraments confer grace, and that of them BaptiÅ¿m, Confirmation, and Order cannot be reiterated without Sacriledge. That the Å¿aid Sacraments have the effect which the Å¿aid Church teacheth, and that the form and uÅ¿age wherewith they be miniÅ¿tred to ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is holy and neceÅ¿Å¿ary. I acknowledge alÅ¿o that the holy MaÅ¿s is a Sacrifice and Oblation of the very Body and Blood of our Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, under the form of bread and Wine mingled with water, which Å¿ubÅ¿tances of Bread and Wine under the Å¿aid Forms (are in the MaÅ¿s by the words which Å¿erve for conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, Å¿aid and pronounced by the PrieÅ¿t) tranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiated, and transformed into the SubÅ¿tance of the Å¿aid body and blood of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. NotwithÅ¿tanding that the Qualities and Accidents remain in the Å¿aid Forms, after the Å¿aid ConÅ¿ecration, and that the MaÅ¿s is wholeÅ¿ome and profitable, as well for the quick as the dead; I acknowledge the concomitance, that is to Å¿ay, that in receiving the body of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, under the form of Bread alone,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170274:129"/>I likewiÅ¿e receive the blood of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. I confeÅ¿s that prayer and interceÅ¿Å¿ion for Å¿aints, for the quick and the dead is Holy, good and Helthful for ChriÅ¿tians, and is not contrary (for any reÅ¿pect) to the glory of God; That Prayers made in the Church for the faithfull which are dead do profit them for the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of their Å¿ins, and leÅ¿Å¿ening of their pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred for the Å¿ame. That there is a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where the Souls abiding, are Å¿uccoured by the prayers of the faithful. I confeÅ¿s that we muÅ¿t honour and call upon the Saints which reign with JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and that they make interceÅ¿Å¿ion for us to God, and that their Reliques are to be worÅ¿hipped. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Traditions, of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, ApoÅ¿tolike, and RomiÅ¿h Church, as well they which pertain to the form and ceremonies of Divine Å¿ervice, and to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the Å¿ame, which I think are to draw ChriÅ¿tian People to Piety, and turning to their God, as FaÅ¿ting, abÅ¿tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from meats, obÅ¿ervation of Holy Dayes, and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical Policy, according to the tradition of the ApoÅ¿tles and Holy Fathers continued Å¿ince the Primitive Church till this time, and afterwards brought into the Church by the Ordinances of Councils received in the Å¿ame of long and Antient time, or of late, be good and holy, to the which I will and ought to obey, as preÅ¿cribed and appointed by the Holy GhoÅ¿t, that the Author and Director of that which Å¿erveth for the keeping of ChriÅ¿tian Religion, and of the Catholike, ApoÅ¿tolike and <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I believe alÅ¿o and accept all the Articles of original Å¿in, and of JuÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. I affirm aÅ¿Å¿uredly that we ought to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170274:130"/>have and keep the Images of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, of his holy Mother, and all other Saints, and do honour and reverence unto them; I confeÅ¿s the power of Indulgence and pardons to be left in the Church by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and the uÅ¿e of them to be very healthful, as alÅ¿o I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeÅ¿s the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Mother and Chief of all Churches; and conducted by the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and that other pretended particular inÅ¿pirations againÅ¿t the Å¿ame, come of the Å¿uggeÅ¿tion of the Devil, the Prince of DiÅ¿Å¿ention, which would Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Union of the MyÅ¿tical body of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World.

                  </note> Another time there was a whole Legion of men cut off for one mans fault; for another mans fault he cauÅ¿ed twenty thouÅ¿and to be killed.

Now all theÅ¿e cruelties were not to be tainted with either perjury, or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170274:132"/>breach of promiÅ¿e, and if it had, it was by a Heathen; but our cruelty and blood-Å¿hed is by a ChriÅ¿tian King, to his own Subjects, in a baÅ¿e Treacherous way, contrary to Oaths, and Covenants before the Eternal God, by a King and Nation that had Å¿o much of the HeatheniÅ¿h darkneÅ¿s diÅ¿perÅ¿ed that we cannot Å¿ay but they were ChriÅ¿tians according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion, though not according to practice.</p>
               <p>Nay had their cruelty and murthers reached no further than to thoÅ¿e they Å¿ay had plotted againÅ¿t them, and Å¿o deÅ¿erved it, then had it been better excuÅ¿able, but why ten thouÅ¿and Innocents in one day, and thirty thouÅ¿and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, all as ignorant of TreaÅ¿on, as the King and Nation guilty of blood and perjury; why Å¿o many poor Innocent Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, poor Ladies and Gentlewomen, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, aged perÅ¿ons, Å¿ick, children, innocent of actual Å¿in, all muÅ¿t dy to quench the blood-thirÅ¿tineÅ¿s of this King, Oh!

               <p>Nay further, had it been in a Å¿udden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿iÅ¿table and mad outrage, of a popular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, guided by the fury of their own fancies; But it was by the Kings Å¿pecial command, they had no other light to guide their bloody zeal, but the Kings Authority, which they Å¿o often mentioned, as the Eccho reached Heaven, but could not peirce their pitty, and done by plots and Contrivances, premeditated and reÅ¿olved to be done.</p>
               <p>And laÅ¿tly, had it been in a time of War, to cut off Å¿o many poor innocent Souls, it might alÅ¿o been Å¿omwhat pardonable, a raging Sword, Å¿ometimes knowing no bounds, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

But all was done in cold blood, not in a Å¿torm, or heat of blood, nay the only time was in peace, and nothing to be Å¿een but favours, and acts of Grace; poor ProteÅ¿tants they were catched in no net, but pretences of Peace, and the fulleÅ¿t demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trations of affections, that might be, nay it was done alÅ¿o contrary to PromiÅ¿es, Covenants and Contracts, making a Mariage to defile it with blood, no other intent being wrapped up in that wedding but a plot for blood.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e Å¿ad and lamentable Spectacles of mans wrath, and the Devils policy, how can it but peirce the very hearts and Souls of all Godly ChriÅ¿tians, nay I dare Å¿ay of ingenuous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿ts, who cannot but abhor the thoughts, and mourn to Å¿ee Å¿uch a bloody Tragedy acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Theatre of a ChriÅ¿tian Kingdom by the Treacherous plot, unheard-of perjury, and down-right command of a ChriÅ¿tian King?</p>

               <p>I find it alÅ¿o recorded by good Authors, that many men of quality, who were both Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the moÅ¿t ingenuous PapiÅ¿ts, whiÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>Many other examples of cruelty might be uÅ¿hered in upon the Stage of ObÅ¿ervation, but what Å¿hould we do with any more, unleÅ¿s we could bring one to parallel it? which by the narroweÅ¿t Å¿earch into all HiÅ¿tory I think can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done.</p>
               <p>Indeed none of theÅ¿e I have named can fix on the borders of this Cruelty; they did it againÅ¿t their Enemies, Å¿ome of them againÅ¿t a forein Nation, but this King <hi>Charls</hi> againÅ¿t his own Subjects, and under the peaceable protection of a Loving King, as they thought. ThoÅ¿e Tyrants owned their bloody acts, and gave reaÅ¿ons for it; but our King <hi>Charls</hi> hid his cruelties in the boÅ¿om of his Councils, and varniÅ¿ht them Å¿o with fine-Å¿pun pretences; that all he did looked not like what he Å¿aid, till God would not let it be hid, but forced him to confeÅ¿s it to all the world.</p>
               <p>The ProteÅ¿tants never could be got to yield to his Power, but his faith and promiÅ¿es; which they depended upon, as a Å¿ure Å¿taff, and prop to lean upon in all times of diÅ¿turbance and tumults; elÅ¿e would their force and valour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have Å¿tooped to his rotten faith, and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red promiÅ¿es; we Å¿ee his promiÅ¿es and Oaths were linked together like Ropes of Å¿and; he intended not to ty himÅ¿elf by the moÅ¿t Å¿olemn Oaths, and Engagements, but Others muÅ¿t be tyed to their Ruin by them.</p>
               <p>What unworthy waies and means this King took (unbecoming the MajeÅ¿ty of a King) to feed his cruel and bloody heart, making uÅ¿e of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170274:134"/>the mariage of his own SiÅ¿ter, as a bait to this horrid villany; and Å¿o abuÅ¿ed the mariage bed with a bloody Tragedy, beÅ¿prinkling her wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Robes with blood; which indignity and diÅ¿honour, no Nation under the Sun, either of former, or of the ages Å¿ince, can forget or paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell.</p>
               <p>It is a piece of Å¿uch baÅ¿e Treachery, as we Å¿hall Å¿ee condemned by the practice of heathens that had only the light of nature; it is Å¿uch a Å¿in as God often times repaies with his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <hi>ValdiÅ¿laus</hi> King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> concluded and confirmed a Peace by Solemn Oath, with the great <hi>Turk Amurath;</hi> but the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> by the <hi>Popes</hi> perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, breaks his Solemn Oath, and wars againÅ¿t the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and proceeding to Battel, the whole day was carried dubious on both Å¿ides; But preÅ¿ently the great <hi>Turk Amurath</hi> takes out of his boÅ¿ome the Articles agreed on, and covenanted too by Oaths, and holding up in his hand, lifting up his eyes to Heaven, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theÅ¿e words; Oh JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t! If thou art a God as theÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tians Å¿ay, Revenge this wrong done to thy name and me, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h theÅ¿e Covenant-Breakers; which words were hardly Å¿poken, but God Å¿hewed his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Judgements on the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and his whole Army; For preÅ¿ently the King <hi>ValdiÅ¿laus</hi> amidÅ¿t his Enemies was Å¿lain, and his whole Army routed, few eÅ¿caping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AgeÅ¿ilaus,</hi> General of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Army, marching in <hi>AÅ¿ia Minor,</hi> made Truce with <hi>TiÅ¿Å¿aphernes</hi> Lieutenant to the King of <hi>PerÅ¿ia,</hi> till he had Å¿ent to the King his MaÅ¿ter to know his PleaÅ¿ure; but inÅ¿tead of Å¿ending to the King for ayd in adviÅ¿e and CounÅ¿el, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Oath, Å¿ends for a Great Army to Å¿urprize the General of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Army; But Gods Judgements followed at the Heels of this perjury; for the Army was quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, according to the propheÅ¿ie of the <hi>Spartan</hi> General, who Å¿aid, the Gods were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170274:137"/>and no doubt would be revenged on his perjury.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> in antient times highly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced faith and Oaths in caÅ¿e of publick affairs between Prince and People, or between King and King; and to that purpoÅ¿e they had a Temple erected, and dedicated, where conÅ¿tantly they uÅ¿ed to repair, and there Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiÅ¿e, and Å¿wear to all the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace and Truces, and Å¿o curÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e that went about to break them firÅ¿t, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for greater and more Å¿trict confirmation thereof, they offered Sacrifices to the Image of Faith, for the greater TeÅ¿timony of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and love to keep their Oaths, moÅ¿t Å¿olemnly made: How will our King <hi>Charls</hi> the Ninth be aÅ¿hamed by theÅ¿e poor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>The PÅ¿almiÅ¿t Å¿ayes, A man ought not to break covenant, but Å¿tand to it though to his great hurt, yet Å¿uch a bold wickedneÅ¿s hath poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿everal <hi>Popes,</hi> that they undertake to diÅ¿charge any that Å¿hall break their oaths with Hereticks as they Å¿ay.</p>
               <p>This audacious and impious practice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting Gods command, calls for vengeance from Heaven.</p>
               <p>That any man Å¿hould be Å¿o boldly blaÅ¿phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as to Å¿ay they will pardon this Å¿in, which God has denounced Å¿uch fearful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>There was in antient time, a people in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> called <hi>Aequi,</hi> their Memory only now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. TheÅ¿e people made League with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and give Oath to keep it; but not
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170274:138"/>long after they raiÅ¿ed an Army, and Å¿poiled the <hi>Romans,</hi> falling on them, contrary to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the <hi>Romans</hi> Å¿end three AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours to complain; but their Captain General Å¿lighted them, and bid them deliver their AmbaÅ¿Å¿y to an Oak-tree Å¿tanding by; One of the three AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours Å¿pake to the Oak-Tree, in theÅ¿e words; Thou hallowed Oak, and what ever elÅ¿e in this place belongs to the Gods, hear and bear witneÅ¿s of this DiÅ¿loyal perjury, and breach of Covenant, and favour our juÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that we may at laÅ¿t by the help of the Gods, be revenged on this perjured people.</p>
               <p>So they returned home, and preÅ¿ently raiÅ¿ed an Army, Å¿et on this perjured people, and by the juÅ¿t Judgements of God utterly deÅ¿troy them off the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>To omit many other Examples of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, take but this one more.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">King of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia.</hi>
                  </note>The King of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives</hi> being at War, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> King, made Truce for Å¿even days; and the third night following fell on them, and made a great Å¿laughter; and with this excuÅ¿e thought to evade the dint of the Å¿hame, and Gods juÅ¿tice: for Å¿ayes he, It is true I made Truce for Å¿even days, but I did not mention nights.</p>
               <p>Yet God followed this perjured King with theÅ¿e Judgements. The Wives of the Å¿lain <hi>Argives</hi> arm under the command of <hi>ToleÅ¿illa</hi> their CaptaineÅ¿s; enter the City, and puts to the Sword and flight the power and forces of the perjured King <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> afterwards he was baniÅ¿hed into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he miÅ¿erably
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170274:138"/>died a deÅ¿perate death, being his own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>
               <p>Thus we Å¿ee what heavy Judgements God has made, and does execute, upon all Å¿uch as are contemners and breakers of this holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and Law of God; The Lord is to be feared and obeyed, for in all his Judgements none greater threatned, nor heavyer and Å¿urer falls on, than on bloody and perjured men. A thing abhorred and hated by Heathens, before ever they were Å¿o far enlightened as to know the Law of God was above the Law of <hi>Nature;</hi> for though they had but the light of Nature, yet they held it a Å¿in unpardonable, and no PuniÅ¿hment accounted enough, as they could invent.</p>
               <p>There were Å¿ome that recorded theÅ¿e cruelties and treacherys of the Kings, and inÅ¿tanced the Law of the twelve Tables. <hi>Si patronus clienti fraudem facit Å¿acer eÅ¿to,</hi> if the Sovereign cheat his Subjects, let them be out of Å¿afety or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>He that in antient time deÅ¿piÅ¿ed the keeping of Oaths, was no more to be called a King. The Right hand was called a Pledge of Faith; The Throne is eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by JuÅ¿tice, and it is an Abomination for Kings to do wickedneÅ¿s: The Throne is upheld by mercy Å¿aies <hi>Solomon,</hi> But this King by his Treachery, Perjury, and Cruelty, degraded himÅ¿elf of his peoples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for he valued not the lives of many thouÅ¿and, Å¿o his bloody cruelty could be Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> accounted it an honourable thing to Å¿ave one Citizen, rather than to kill a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and Enemies. There was no power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170274:139"/>Å¿o great as the Dictators at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was Å¿uch an AÅ¿Å¿embly which met together, as had the power of War and Peace, nay they had the command of life and death at their will, and that without any Appeal; and yet it was not lawful for them to execute a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, unleÅ¿s his cauÅ¿e was publickly and juÅ¿tly heard, and he legally committed and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>But indeed it is the manner of Murtherers to bereave of life without Law, or cauÅ¿e of death. Nay had this horrid MaÅ¿Å¿aere been a bare down-right murther, it had been the leÅ¿s; but it was covered with fraud and deceit. The King and Court muÅ¿t perÅ¿onate a Religious habit, and pretence of a Religious vow, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods holy Ordinance Å¿toop to his deceitful and tteacherous intention.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Duties of Kings and Powers of the World, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with prudent Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Å¿ound ChriÅ¿tianity.</head>
                  <p>A King ought by his ChriÅ¿tian demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have a rich Å¿tore-houÅ¿e and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer of Affection, and allegiance in his peoples hearts; and he, who takes care therein to lay Å¿uch proviÅ¿ion of love, as that it may be as a firm Rock, as a Å¿trong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, what is there then that he may not command, which is in their power to perform, then the arms of the peoples affections open, and are Å¿pread to imbrace any command; this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170274:139"/>is the way to have the key of their hearts, and to open that treaÅ¿ury of reÅ¿pect; which by the wiÅ¿e mannagement of his power (received from them) he hath ready laid up.</p>
                  <p>Loving Subjects are moÅ¿t uniting in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious conÅ¿ent of obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; love to a Prince created by himÅ¿elf, will make cowards valourous, even to defend him from the Å¿hock of his Enemies aÅ¿Å¿aults: And it is Å¿een with greateÅ¿t luÅ¿tre, and to his beÅ¿t advantage in his Straights, when he hath made all his Subjects on the leaÅ¿t notice, ready to be voluntiers in the greateÅ¿t dangers, and hotteÅ¿t attempts for the Honour of their own Prince.</p>
                  <p>But when Kings Å¿pend too much on the Å¿tock of his Peoples willing minds of Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and prodigally trade away that Å¿tock of Love treaÅ¿ured up in his people, what does he but expoÅ¿e himÅ¿elf to all aÅ¿Å¿aults of fury and cruelty, without pitty? as it has been the end of many Princes; nay when love is abuÅ¿ed and turned to hatred, in what a tottering Throne does he Å¿it?</p>
                  <p>But whatÅ¿oever the Theory of an abÅ¿olute Monarchy be, yet a Good King loves the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part of JuÅ¿tice, his Power being more Å¿afe in his Laws than his Will. Though his power and his Command may claim a Å¿trong Authority to do as he pleaÅ¿es; yet he will not make his Power arbitrary, nor beyond the limit of equal juÅ¿tice to all.</p>
                  <p>Now for OppreÅ¿Å¿ion, Tyranny, Cruelty, and perjury, to be Å¿eated in the heart of a King, and he in the heart of his Kingdome, Oh!
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170274:140"/>how it levells his peoples affections, and Å¿tems the tide and current of their allegiance, razes the very foundation of his own Å¿ecurity, and is the moÅ¿t compendious way to his own utter ruin.</p>
                  <p>It doth by a Å¿trange inÅ¿tinct, raiÅ¿e tumults, and viciÅ¿Å¿itudes, that like a rapid Torrent of confuÅ¿ion, falls upon his own head, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his vicious merits. What foundation can Å¿uch a King have, when it is builded on a Quagmire, Å¿eated on the terrible aÅ¿pect of the peoples hatred, accrewing by his Treacherous Tyranny?</p>
                  <p>An ingenuous people can no more brook op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion, than the River <hi>Danube,</hi> can mix with the muddy Å¿treams of <hi>Sava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this King to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h his Throne of Cruelty, and Tyranny; Peaceable like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troaths his People and HimÅ¿elf, in an indiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oluble bond of Peace, never to be broke on his part, yet no Å¿ooner made before the view of heaven, and in the Å¿ight and preÅ¿ence of God, but he regiÅ¿ters his falÅ¿ehood, cruelty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in a Å¿uddain breach, with the blood of his own Subjects, taking the advantage of their punctual obÅ¿ervance, to diÅ¿arm them, and take their Towns, which on the peace granted were delivered; and Å¿o erects his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Engines of deceit upon the ruins of his own promiÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>Now ChriÅ¿tian Reader let us a little Å¿ee the Å¿mall probability that the Admiral Å¿hould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt what they pretend; which reaÅ¿ons, for general Å¿atisfaction, I Å¿hall gather together; becauÅ¿e it is declared by the King, that it was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170274:140"/>for a Plot againÅ¿t him and the Court, although it is clear, that it was reÅ¿olved on by the King, Queen Mother, and Cabinet Council, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy the Admiral and his Friends; which by the Kings Commandment is lamentably, and wofully effected, to the great diÅ¿honour of the King, and the whole French Nation, and cannot but ly as a blot to after ages; and a time there muÅ¿t be to Å¿atisfy God and the World for it.</p>
                  <p>Now who can imagine, that the Admiral Å¿hould think with a few Gentlemen allowed for his Guard, to attempt any thing againÅ¿t the King, within <hi>Paris,</hi> there being in the Court conÅ¿tant watch, and at the entrance to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle, a Å¿trong Guard of <hi>Scots, Switzers,</hi> and <hi>GaÅ¿eoins,</hi> and was then more Å¿trictly kept in regard of the number of Lords, Noble-men, and Gentlemen, met to Å¿olemnize the mariage of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> and that it is well known that in three hours Å¿pace, may be ready at command, Å¿ixty thouÅ¿and men in arms.</p>
                  <p>BeÅ¿ides all theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons, the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen that came with the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> had no other arms than their Swords and Innocency; which latter in the greateÅ¿t danger would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them beÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>And yet further to clear all doubts, the Princes and Noblemen of the ProteÅ¿tants, for a Pledge, and TeÅ¿timony for a Solemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of their innocency, they brought with them, their Wives, SiÅ¿ters, Children and KinÅ¿women, having no thoughts of any
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170274:141"/>thing but Triumph and Recreation; The Nobles and Gentlemen intending to Å¿hew their expert skill at the Tilt and Tourney.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be Å¿aid it was after the Admirals Hurt, that he Å¿tudied to be revenged.</p>
                  <p>It is anÅ¿wered, With what probability can any Å¿ober mind, imagine or conceive that the Admiral lying wounded on both arms, tyed up, and hourly waiting when one Arm Å¿hould be cut off by the Doctors adviÅ¿e, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, I Å¿ay, being Guarded by the Kings own Guard, Å¿hould attempt with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen of his Guard, to Å¿urprize the King, &amp;c. being Å¿o Å¿ick as few daies was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to paÅ¿s over, till God would call him to himÅ¿elf, that any Å¿hould think three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Å¿o reÅ¿olute as to Å¿et upon a City wherein was Å¿ixty thouÅ¿ond in Armes by the firÅ¿t A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum?</p>
                  <p>But doubtleÅ¿s had Å¿uch a thing been known or Å¿uÅ¿pected, he would have been Å¿ecured by <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿in</hi> and his men, who had by the Kings commandment environed and beÅ¿et him; how Å¿oon might the Å¿ick Admiral been apprehended as well as murthered?</p>
                  <p>There was never any thing laid to his charge which could be proved by the leaÅ¿t witneÅ¿s, nor what they laid to his charge, had the leaÅ¿t men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, place, adherents, means, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s; Å¿o that if it had been proved or Å¿uÅ¿pect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King Å¿hould have proceeded according to Law and JuÅ¿tice, which are well known to be the props and Pillars on which a Kingdoms happineÅ¿s Å¿tands Å¿ecure.</p>
                  <p>But Å¿uppoÅ¿e we that all theÅ¿e things had been
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170274:141"/>really true, and that the manner of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals death and his Complices had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable by all nations, yet let us conÅ¿ider a little, and demand a reaÅ¿on of the inÅ¿olent cruelty, infamous barbariÅ¿m, and unheard-of bloodÅ¿hed, of thoÅ¿e, that were thought by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves altogether innocent of any plot, being antient Matrons, many Noble young Ladies, and Gentlewomen in the flour of their Age, cut off Å¿o baÅ¿ely and barbarouÅ¿ly, a number of women great with child, againÅ¿t the Law of nature were caÅ¿t into Rivers before the time of their Delivery; many aged perÅ¿ons alÅ¿o which lay Å¿ick in Bed, Many CounÅ¿ellours, Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, Proctors, PhyÅ¿icians, &amp;c. that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ulted only with their books, and the reÅ¿t Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿tered from the conference of any CounÅ¿el, by the Sex and degrees; Why was there alÅ¿o Å¿o many learned Teachers and ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors of the Arts and Sciences; amongÅ¿t whom was <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> that famous man for learning through out the world, who Å¿tands in the memory of the truly learned, as really, as theÅ¿e bloody actours render <hi>France</hi> infamous? How many young Students, without hearing or pleading their cauÅ¿e, were here deÅ¿troyed by this Å¿ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the King and Council?</p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿tly, what Armour was found, what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons was found in any of the ProteÅ¿tants hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, by which means Å¿uÅ¿pition might grow to proof? Or why was the Kings Letters Å¿ent to command the like murthers at <hi>Meaux, Lyons, Troys, TholouÅ¿e,</hi> and all over his Dominions, Å¿uch Å¿laughters were committed till the very blood of Gods Å¿aints made the Rivers Å¿well, and Å¿treamed through the Å¿treets reaking hot,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170274:142"/>that at leaÅ¿t 40000. were Å¿lain by his bloody command.</p>
                  <p>Thus has this King and Court imbrewed their hands in the blood of Å¿o many thouÅ¿and innocent Å¿ouls, even to the great expectation of Å¿ome vengeance, which in Gods due time muÅ¿t needs break out on that land, to the third and fourth Generation; if a General repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance do not expiate this deÅ¿erved puniÅ¿hment.</p>
                  <p>Now ChriÅ¿tian Reader, to bring this Kings reign to a cloÅ¿e, I Å¿hall only abÅ¿tract the moÅ¿t notable paÅ¿Å¿ages together, which hapned after this Å¿ad MaÅ¿Å¿acre.</p>

               <p>AFter this Å¿ad and lamentable Butchery and blood-Å¿hed, the poor ProteÅ¿tants that were eÅ¿caped, fled with all Å¿peed to the Å¿everal Sanctuaries, which God in his mercy had decreed for their preÅ¿ervation.

               <p>The poor diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed remnant of ProteÅ¿tants in <hi>Dauphine, Provence</hi> and <hi>Lyonois,</hi> fled into <hi>SwiÅ¿Å¿erland,</hi> amongÅ¿t whom was the Admirals Å¿ons and <hi>Andelots,</hi> who by the fame of their Fathers Authority, and the tenderneÅ¿s of their years, were joyfully welcomed from Å¿uch a Land flowing with blood and vengeance.</p>
               <p>Some imploy their time and Talents in Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth to the World in Writing this horrid Treachery and MaÅ¿Å¿acre acted in <hi>France,</hi> and to let all the ProteÅ¿tants in other parts of the World beware by their Å¿ad example: letting the World know the Å¿tratagem that the <hi>French</hi> Court uÅ¿e, is to deÅ¿troy by Peace, and that to Å¿hake hands in a peace with PapiÅ¿ts, is the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170274:144"/>ready way to deÅ¿truction; the inÅ¿tance whereof was Å¿o freÅ¿h in their minds, that they needed no grand Jury of examples to inforce belief; their own late woful experience being Å¿ufficient to teÅ¿tifie this for a truth.</p>
               <p>The ProteÅ¿tants of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Campagn</hi> fled to the Cities of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ProteÅ¿tants in the heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and towards <hi>Rochel,</hi> flocked to Å¿ome Å¿trong Towns, which it pleaÅ¿ed God of his goodneÅ¿s to reÅ¿erve for their Å¿afety, which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they fortified with all the Å¿trength they could; They that inhabited in the IÅ¿le of <hi>France, Nivernois,</hi> and <hi>BeauÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> were poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed of <hi>Sancerre.</hi> ThoÅ¿e that lived in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>GaÅ¿coiny,</hi> placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in <hi>NiÅ¿mes</hi> and <hi>Montaubon.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants in <hi>Guienne, Poictou, Zaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> fled to <hi>Rochel;</hi> which proved a Å¿afe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from the cruel Birds of Prey; <hi>Henry Jaques,</hi> Maior of the City, had the Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof. To this City alÅ¿o reÅ¿orted three thouÅ¿and five hundred men, and came from Å¿undry parts, which had been Souldiers in the Wars, and men of approved valour; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o to their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance came fifty Gentlemen of good quality from the adjoining parts about the City; there came thither alÅ¿o fifty Å¿even MiniÅ¿ters of Gods Word, which by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were preÅ¿erved in this Å¿ad blow; and for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and other ProviÅ¿ion, there wanted none to Å¿upply their neceÅ¿Å¿ity of a Å¿trong and laÅ¿ting Å¿iege.</p>
               <p>Now at laÅ¿t the King, Queen Mother, with his Brethren and Court, orders a Day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thankÅ¿giving, to be returned for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170274:144"/>the good SucceÅ¿s againÅ¿t the ProteÅ¿tants. Thus they reared up CaÅ¿tles of Triumph to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diÅ¿honour, which practice is condemned by a <hi>Turk, Sultan Orchan</hi> Å¿econd, King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> when he had overcome the ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Battail,</hi> word being brought to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿e was demanded what Å¿hould be done to thoÅ¿e PriÅ¿oners that yet alive remained in their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whether they Å¿hould be killed or not? who more like a ChriÅ¿tian than a <hi>Turk</hi> replyed, Oh no, it is not the part of a Souldier to drown Mercy in Cruelty, for Å¿aies this brave <hi>Sultan, Mercy is the Alms of Victory,</hi> a noble Å¿aying of a Heathen.</p>
               <p>Now the King Å¿ends <hi>MonÅ¿ieur de Byron</hi> to <hi>Rochell,</hi> to place a GarriÅ¿on, the ProteÅ¿tants refuÅ¿e it; being a priviledge granted them by the King to receive no GarriÅ¿ons; whereupon <hi>Byron</hi> proclaims a War againÅ¿t them. Poor Å¿ouls, they had Å¿adly felt the Å¿mart of the K. perfidiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, by their too credulous opinion of theÅ¿e fair pretences; and therfore now thought good to preÅ¿erve their lives from Treachery, or dy with honour.</p>
               <p>And now to let the World know what little reality is Å¿ometimes found in Princes; the King of <hi>France</hi> declares to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the war which he Å¿eemingly countenanced under command of <hi>Count Lodowick</hi> of <hi>NaÅ¿Å¿aw,</hi> was only a plot to bring about his ends; which as it could not be Å¿een by all, Å¿o could it not but be believed by the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> Å¿o that the undertakers under <hi>Count Lodowick,</hi> were Å¿harply perÅ¿ecuted by them that afterwards got power over them.</p>
               <p>Thus were theÅ¿e poor Souldiers betrayed out
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170274:145"/>of the Kings own Treachery. Only <hi>MonÅ¿ieur de la Nove</hi> was preÅ¿erved Å¿ecretly; who being Å¿afely conducted to the Kings Court, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty commands him to <hi>Rochel,</hi> to Å¿olicite the City to a CompoÅ¿ition, Brave <hi>MonÅ¿ieur de la Nove,</hi> Å¿toutly, and like a ChriÅ¿tian, anÅ¿wers the King, That it was againÅ¿t his ConÅ¿cience to adviÅ¿e his fellow ProteÅ¿tants, to lay their throats open to them that would too readily cut them; But the King commands, and together with his Å¿ecret deÅ¿ire to Å¿ee <hi>Rochel</hi> Å¿purs him on, Å¿o having came to <hi>MonÅ¿ieur de Byron,</hi> who was at <hi>St. Jean de Angeli,</hi> and after a viÅ¿it to him, delivering the Kings MeÅ¿Å¿age, he enters <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi> who by a joint ConÅ¿ent of all the City was choÅ¿en their Captain General, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted of it, and gave a good proof of his faithful adherence to the ProteÅ¿tant cauÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January,</hi> by the Kings Commandment, <hi>MonÅ¿ieur de la Chastre</hi> with Å¿ix thouÅ¿and men, beÅ¿ieges <hi>Sancere;</hi> where finding a furious and reÅ¿olute Enemy, which would not yield to their Summons, after the expences of great toil and labour, diÅ¿charging in two moneths about Å¿ix thouÅ¿and Cannon Å¿hot, they made an aÅ¿Å¿ault, but were bravely repulÅ¿ed to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal praiÅ¿e of the <hi>Sancerrois</hi> valour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olution. The 18. of <hi>March</hi> by a Å¿econd bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery on all Å¿ides, they at laÅ¿t made a great breach, and Å¿o aÅ¿Å¿ault and attempt to Å¿cale, but the beÅ¿ieged (who queÅ¿tionleÅ¿s had many friends Å¿lain in the bloody MaÅ¿Å¿acre) had Å¿ome Å¿parks of their Friends blood in their minds, which then Å¿hewed it Å¿elf in their reÅ¿olutions; that they fall on the Enemy by a Å¿trong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and made not only a Halt in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170274:145"/>proceedings, but made them retreat with the loÅ¿s of Å¿ixty of their beÅ¿t Souldiers dead in the ditch, two hundred mortally wounded, and two hundred utterly lamed; all with the loÅ¿s of Å¿eventeen men of the ProteÅ¿tants; which piece of valour Å¿o cooled the courage of the Kings Army, that they reÅ¿olved no more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to be made again Å¿uch impregnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants. So they begirt them cloÅ¿e on all Å¿ides, no relief being able to come to them; which did Å¿o extreamly Å¿treighten the beÅ¿ieged, that they were forced to eat their AÅ¿Å¿es, Mules, HorÅ¿es, Cats, Dogs, Mice, Moles, Leather, and at laÅ¿t to eat parchment, and trappings of HorÅ¿es, horns, wild roots, Girdles, making bread of the Å¿eeds of flax, and herbs mixed with Bran, and of Å¿traw and NutÅ¿hels, they made uÅ¿e of Å¿lates, GreaÅ¿e, Tallow, and Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Å¿erved for pottage, frying therewith the Excrements of HorÅ¿es and Men; nay the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry filth in the Å¿treets alÅ¿o; Å¿uch as went out to Å¿eek relief, were either killed by the Enemy, or lived on Sprigs of Vines, herbs, red Snails and Blackberries; they endured all miÅ¿eries till fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine had imprinted old age on the ViÅ¿ages of Children, Å¿o that the youths appeared like the GhoÅ¿ts of the deceaÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>Eighty perÅ¿ons died by the Sword, but the famine deÅ¿troyed five hundred. Some Souldiers and TownÅ¿men, chooÅ¿ing to caÅ¿t themÅ¿elves upon the Enemy, than dy by famine, adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out; whereof Å¿ome were killed, Å¿ome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿oned, and others executed: The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Å¿worn that he would make them devour one another, was diÅ¿appointed by a Å¿pecial hand of Providence, and a thing no waies expected
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170274:146"/>by the beÅ¿ieged ProteÅ¿tants, who indeed look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a general MaÅ¿Å¿acre according to the K. threats; who was reÅ¿olved to bring their houÅ¿es of a threatning height as low as their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their aÅ¿piring reÅ¿olute minds, lower than them, reÅ¿olving to raze the City into a Å¿olitude, and to bury his ReÅ¿olution in their Ruin: but it pleaÅ¿ed God that the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> this Kings Brother, being choÅ¿en K: of <hi>Poland,</hi> AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours were comming for him, and by the way hearing of this Å¿iege, they earneÅ¿tly Å¿olicite the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Valence</hi> to perform his promiÅ¿e, for the BiÅ¿hop had Å¿worn in the name of the King his MaÅ¿ter that all Towns moleÅ¿ted for <hi>Religion</hi> Å¿hould be free. So the poor Town was Å¿aved from the fury of a bloody and cruel Enemy, and yielded on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to depart with their arms, bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, thoÅ¿e that Å¿tayed to be free from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queÅ¿tion for what was paÅ¿t, with a promiÅ¿e to preÅ¿erve the Honour of women and maids.</p>
               <p>The King, with an Army of fifty thouÅ¿and men, and Å¿ixty pieces of Artillery, beÅ¿ieges <hi>Rochel</hi> both by Sea and Land. The Town was fortified Å¿trongly, nothing wanting to annoy the Enemy, and encourage valor among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves. In one Months time was Å¿hot no leÅ¿s than thirteen thouÅ¿and cannon, and many aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿auls: But alas the Catholicks were too weak to encounter with the ProteÅ¿tants Å¿trength and Courage. Till at length having endured Å¿ome Moneths, the King, Queen Mother, Duke of <hi>Arjou,</hi> all the Nobles, with the Cavalry and all the Infantry both <hi>SwiÅ¿s</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> arrive to this famous Å¿iege the beginning of <hi>February</hi> 1572. of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, there was the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170274:146"/>Duke of <hi>Alancon,</hi> third Brother to the King, the Duke of <hi>MontpenÅ¿eir;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>Mayen,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The Duke of <hi>Nevers, Bouillon, D' U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qes,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the Prince <hi>Dauphine,</hi> the Count of <hi>Manlevrier,</hi> MarÅ¿hal <hi>de CoÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> the BaÅ¿tard, <hi>De AngouleÅ¿m,</hi> the <hi>Count de Retz, MonÅ¿ieur de Moluc,</hi> and all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Commanders in the Civil Wars and MaÅ¿Å¿acre.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rochel</hi> there was a great number of HorÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Gentlemen, eight Companies of Inhabitants, nine companies of Strangers, one Company of the <hi>Mayers,</hi> one Company of Volentiers, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of twenty MuÅ¿quetiers, twenty five armed with CoÅ¿tlets of Proof, and thirty Harquebuzeirs; Two thirds whereof were Gentlemen and Å¿uch as had command in the late wars.</p>
               <p>The Å¿iege continued with great valour on both Å¿ides, and great loÅ¿s to the Kings Army; which in the aÅ¿Å¿aults made, and often Å¿allies, loÅ¿t the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> and <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿in</hi> Field-MarÅ¿hal, who was the firÅ¿t that entered the Admirals lodging; an infinite number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Officers, with twenty thouÅ¿and Souldiers, and the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> wounded in the Neck, Å¿ide and left hand by a Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzeir: but Å¿ix thouÅ¿and freÅ¿h <hi>Switzers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Å¿iege, did much Å¿traiten the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> that at laÅ¿t having no hope of Relief, they grew in great want of Victuals, yet in their Å¿traits the hand of good was wonderfully Å¿een; for in the midÅ¿t of their wants, when all other proviÅ¿ion failed, there came before the Haven an infinite number of Å¿mall fiÅ¿hes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170274:147"/>a great Supply in their needs. Which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Å¿ign of Gods goodneÅ¿s amazed them the more, becauÅ¿e it was never before, nor Å¿ince that ever the like was Å¿een.</p>
               <p>During this Å¿harp Å¿iege, the Å¿ame occaÅ¿ion happened now, as did at <hi>Sancerre;</hi> for the AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours of <hi>Poland</hi> being come for the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> proved a relief for the <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> when they expected none. So Articles were agreed on both Å¿ides, That there Å¿hould be a free exerciÅ¿e of Religion in <hi>Rochel, Montauban</hi> and <hi>NiÅ¿mes,</hi> and to other Towns to be in their houÅ¿es without Å¿earch, That BaptiÅ¿m and Matrimony Å¿hould be freely adminiÅ¿tred, not above ten perÅ¿ons meeting together: and that thoÅ¿e that had a mind to Å¿ell their eÅ¿tates might do it, and live where they pleaÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the two famous Å¿ieges of <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Sancerre.</hi> Let us now obÅ¿erve a little the TranÅ¿actions of both parties during theÅ¿e Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>WhilÅ¿t theÅ¿e Å¿ieges continued, the other Provinces which the ProteÅ¿tants had in their power, they fortifie. The Baron of <hi>Serignac,</hi> a diÅ¿creet and virtuous ProteÅ¿tant, and no leÅ¿s valourous, did with Å¿ome others fortifie <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> and afterwards they advance into the Field with their Troops, and garriÅ¿on <hi>Terride,</hi> aÅ¿Å¿ault <hi>Buzet</hi> upon <hi>Tar,</hi> and many other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Å¿trongly fortifies the Towns that they had kept during the Civil Wars; Å¿o at an AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿embly held at <hi>Realmont</hi> in <hi>Albigeois,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent to Å¿eparate to their Å¿everal charges apart.</p>

But was it ever read of in Å¿uch a Å¿mall HiÅ¿tory, and in Wars of Å¿o Å¿hort time that ever there was Å¿uch a common breach of faith and promiÅ¿e when Å¿igned and Å¿ealed for a Å¿trict obÅ¿ervance, as a good Author Å¿ays, he that is a baÅ¿e Å¿o, is conÅ¿tantly falÅ¿e in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip. The Count being in his Enemies cuÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yielded to too much cruelty, on terms of mercy; who I dare Å¿ay, had rather died a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and deaths like a true Souldier, then be Å¿o baÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delt withal, for in the night he was guarded
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170274:149"/>away PriÅ¿oner to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there baÅ¿ely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the Å¿ight of the King, and Q. Mother, who received much joy at his death; but the juÅ¿t God Å¿aw all theÅ¿e treacheries, and juÅ¿tly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded Å¿ome according to their bloody deÅ¿erts.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude this Å¿ad and dolefull reign of a bloody Tyrant; let us Å¿ee after his blood reign and flatigious life, a Å¿ad and Å¿uita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death, a Å¿pectacle of Gods anger, and an embleme of his bloody dealing; who falling Å¿ick in the prime of his years, being forced to his Bed, he was Å¿ore tormented and handled with a great effuÅ¿ion of blood, which iÅ¿Å¿ued out of all parts of his body; and that which very much aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed many, he did once rowl himÅ¿elf in hit own blood, vomiting blood through all the Conduits of his body; that it may be Å¿aid as of <hi>Tiberius CaeÅ¿ar, Lutum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Maceratum,</hi> a lump of clay Å¿oaked in blood. So this King by the juÅ¿t judgement of God expired his laÅ¿t, the 24. year of his age, and in the year of our Lord God 1574. <hi>Julius CaeÅ¿ar</hi> Å¿acrificing to the Gods, found a BeaÅ¿t without a heart, which was looked upon as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ominous; and Å¿urely may we not infer from this Kings bloody reign, that he <hi>Had no heart, a bloody Heart,</hi> or, <hi>A Heart, and a Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this King, having lived in other mens blood, dyed in his own; which as it was the iÅ¿Å¿ue of his own deÅ¿erts, Å¿o it was an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of Gods juÅ¿tice.</p>
               <p>And it cannot but be taken notice of that the reÅ¿t of the chief Agents of this bloody Tragedy were Å¿trangly and juÅ¿tly cut off. The Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> being then King of <hi>Poland,</hi> Å¿ucceeds this King <hi>Charls,</hi> by being called from
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170274:150"/>
                  <hi>Poland</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Yet God follows him, for by the means of a young <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobine Monck,</hi> named <hi>Fryer Jaques Clement,</hi> the Å¿aid King was Å¿tabbed in the Å¿ame Chamber where he held Council for the acting the late Tragedies.</p>
               <p>The juÅ¿t hand of God perÅ¿ued the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e,</hi> who was murthered in the Kings own Chamber, five and fourty waiting with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Poinyards to do it.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother with grief broke her heart, and died the firÅ¿t of <hi>January</hi> after.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it hath been obÅ¿erved by a good Author, that Å¿ince the year of God, 1560. that of a thouÅ¿and murtherers which remained unpuniÅ¿hed by men, there was not ten eÅ¿caped the Divine hand of God, but came to deÅ¿erved and wretched ends, Å¿uitable to their bloody and butcherly lives.</p>
