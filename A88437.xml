            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle to the READER.</head>
            <p>THIS following Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is a Theme ſo ſadly copious, that if thou art a true Proteſtant, thou canſt not but bewail the ſad fate of many thouſand innocent Chriſtians whoſe ſufferings, and their enemies cruelty ſtrove for preheminence, who died not ſo much like Martyrs, as murthered like ſheep; being not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by force, but betrayed by Treachery, and perjury. Who can but from the depth of ſadneſs turn his ſorrow into tears, forcing open the bowels of his compaſsion, through
<pb facs="tcp:170274:7"/>the flood-gates of his eyes; when we ſhall conſider, ſo many Lords and Gallant Commanders breath their laſt, by an ignominous and baſe death, not to be compared for cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perjury and treachery, in any age or Hiſtory; for indeed theſe ſad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities challenge the Tribute of a bleeding heart; ſo that if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders underſtanding be not already garriſoned with prejudice, or if the times be but patient of hearing truth this Book may prove of ſome uſe to this Nation.</p>
            <p>The ruins of Truth is often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velloped in the ſable clouds of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion. <hi>Nimium altercando amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur,</hi> Truth may be loſt in a crowd; therefore my induſtry to preſerve an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, may ſtand as an argument againſt calumny; for each Book preſt into the world, is as a Bark at Sea; the firſt as ſubject to cenſure, as the laſt to ſtorms; therfore I cannot but expect a ſhower of cenſures; yet, as
<pb facs="tcp:170274:7"/>Mr. <hi>Feltham</hi> ſaies, <hi>It is the eaſieſt part to cenſure; and though men think thereby to be accounted wiſe, yet</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcovers a Fool more;</hi> for he that knows leaſt cenſures moſt; Ignorance gives diſparagement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a lowder tongue than knowledge; like Rats that love to eat Books they cannot read, and however I may ſuffer the venome of Aſps, which grow on ſome mens tongues, yet have I done without crime, what I ought to do in conſcience; and the more impetuous the ſtorms, and rapid torrents of calumny aſſault and beat upon my endeavours, the more ſhall I, like the Traveller in the Fable, hug my ſelf in the Cloak of my own Innocency and Integrity; that though the ſucceſs of my Labour prove abortive to ſome, yet ſhall I enjoy the fredom of my own deſire, and reward my ſelf with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that the envious World can
<pb facs="tcp:170274:8"/>neither give, nor take from me.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to the World that ſomething of this nature is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, yet may I humbly and truly ſay, is ſhort of this: for the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Structures and compoſure of this Narrative, fetches his Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als from ſundry Authors, both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and Antient; and being cul'd from the Reliques of Antiquity, by a careful gleaning out of many into one, may therefore challenge the privilege to ſay, that all others want ſomewhat of this; being an exact Epitomy of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſages of the Civil Wars, during this Kings Reign; yet as ſuccinct as an orderly proceeding can admit. And Courteous Reader, that thou mayeſt be perſwaded to go further then the Entrance, I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, that the body of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is collected from the beſt Writers of both ſides, whoſe tinctures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection according to their Byaſſes, is
<pb facs="tcp:170274:8"/>ſo ballanced, that the Narrative ſtands free from the prejudicate part of either, being as impartial as pen can collect from the Original of antient Records; and as well diſtanced from the gaſhes of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Pen, as the two Poles from one another, or the <hi>Antipodes</hi> from us. For I find what any Proteſtant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſerts of the worſt part, is no leſs publiſhed, than known by the Catholicks themſelves, for they cannot deny the act, only they excuſe the manner. And this advantage will come by this collection, that whereas it was in large volumes, now it is reduced and fitted to the time, and purſes of thoſe that had no occaſion, and leſs abilities to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the peruſal or purchaſing of large <hi>Folio's,</hi> which I think was the grand reaſon of ſtifling the knowledge hereof to many of this age.</p>
            <p>Reader, thou art here preſented
<pb facs="tcp:170274:9"/>with the moſt horrid Rapes, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Perjury, and Treacherous Cruelty of a Prince and Court, that ever landed on <hi>European</hi> ſhore, for in few daies all the Proteſtant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, with Ladies and innocent Gentlewomen and children to the number of fourty thouſand, were inhumanely butchered, and cut off by the Kings ſpecial Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here thou mayeſt ſee a Prince beſmearing himſelf with the Goar blood of his own Subjects, and at laſt wallowing in his own; we ſhall here ſee Religious Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, no ſtronger ties to the King, and Court, than a Rope of ſand to a wild beaſt; being gone ſo far in perjury, that the Kings faith was accounted like the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe unfaithfulneſs to their promiſes, is become Proverbial, that when one would expreſs perjury, they term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it <hi>Greca fides,</hi> for though a Creditor had ten bonds, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:170274:9"/>Sureties and Seals, yet will he find it extreme hard to accompliſh his debt: ſo when a <hi>Jew</hi> is to deal with a <hi>Genoa,</hi> he puts his finger in his eye fearing his Treachery. They reſolve to have no other virtue ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant than perjury and cruelty; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning that part of Religion, which ties to a ſtrict obſervance of Duty. <hi>Omnia Religioſa nunc ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur;</hi> they will wade no further in Religion than may ſerve their cruel ends; inſomuch, that in one Town which the Proteſtants kept, they engraved on the gate this <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Roy ſans foy, ville ſans peur,</hi> the King had no faith, nor they no fear. And as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> ſaid of <hi>Seneca's</hi> Works, they were <hi>Arena ſine calce,</hi> ſand without lime, having no connexion, ſo was the King of <hi>France</hi> his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths, and Promiſes. It is a Chriſtian accompliſhment in Princes to govern, <hi>non per timorem, ſed

            <p>Now the right uſe of theſe ſad and ſudden murthers ſhould be to learn us the neceſsity of being ready prepared for ſuch violent deaths, and that proſperity is as diet to us, Adverſity as Phyſick, reducing to a right taſt of theſe mortal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; How happy will the Torments of cruelty be, when our cyes are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith on an Eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, linking our ſelves in that golden Chain of Salvation, which
<pb facs="tcp:170274:10"/>extends from Eternity to Eternity, Death comes not unexpected when a ſoul is intereſſed in Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; how neceſſary is it for us to live ready to dy. He that too cloſely hugs tranſitories, makes a rent in his conſtancy, and a greater in his ſoul. How can a Chriſtians Judgement but be at nonage, when he values not the true worth of Celeſtials, but puts them in the ballance with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene things; He indeed hath found the Philoſophers ſtone, that can turn all events into a Subjection to Gods Will. It was the gratious words of Holy <hi>Greenham,</hi> having food and rayment let us take the reſt as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus: theſe poor Souls had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warning peice to dy than ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and violent deaths; that like the flying fiſh, reported to be in great hazzard, by the <hi>Shark</hi> and <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> in the Sea, yet when advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the air to eſcape, he is by Birds of prey in no leſs danger; ſo
<pb facs="tcp:170274:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>were theſe poor Saints of God; in War hazardous, in Peace undone; What ſhall we ſay of that Religion, which perjury, cruelty, blood and the greateſt cruelties, are reckoned as virtuous Jewels in the Crown of their Government, they are ſweet when ſeaſonable and parallel to their murtherous Hearts, and it muſt needs preſage ruin to that Nation, that ſtands on no other Pillars for their foundation, than bloody and infamous Plots, and Treachery; who will not conclude that Nation lies level to juſtice, and I wiſh the large field of Liberty allowed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to walk in, may not inſenſably grow our ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable and ſwift ruin, ſince it is well known by all how they wait for our deſtruction.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170274:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>was alſo attended with the ſable clouds of <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellum Dei,</hi> which ſwept both Field and City. The beginning of his wicked Reign had a bloudy ending to the poor Kingdom, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for the bodies of the murthered Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants was a Prey to the Birds of the Air, and Beaſts of the Fields; the whole Nation wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penſive Weeds of a Ruinous Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for through the Lords juſt Judgments on the Nation, they ſuffer nothing leſs than all Roberies, Rapes, and all ſorts of Cruelties, with horrid Maſſacres for the ſpace of twelve years. And as the Prologue of his Reign was Perjury and Treachery, ſo was the Epilogue Bloudy to himſelf, and poor Nation, eſpecially to the poor innocent Proteſtants.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſits, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Queen Mother du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Kings mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority.</note>A Parliament being called, they begin the 23. of <hi>December.</hi> Now at this time in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> was <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> Pope <hi>Clements</hi> Brothers Daughter, and this Kings Mother, who being born in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> a City of <hi>Italy,</hi> had conferr'd upon her the Government of this Kingdom in the Kings minority; for it is well known that according to the Laws of this Nation, neither the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration nor Inheritance thereof, can juſtly be caſt on the ſhoulders of a Woman; and yet againſt this Law, and through the negligence of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the ſaid Queen Mother was joyned with him in the Office of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorſhip; the confirmation of her Regency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed of by the Chancellour; was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confirmed by the Speakers.</p>
               <p>Now in this Aſſembly of Parliament, one <hi>John Quintin</hi> (a Doctor of the Common Law at <hi>Paris</hi> for the Clergy) pleads that none of the

               <p>Many good and neceſſary Laws were then publiſhed, but with more confuſiom than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for Laws though good and many, yet through want of a due execution by the Magiſtrates power, makes the good intent thereof to be perverted and turned into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct Channel, giving the people cauſe to ſlight ſuch wholeſom Laws, and grow bad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a good Government.</p>

Now the Queen Mother by her ſubtil and natural inſight to ſecret affairs, judged ſo at their Diſcontent, that ſhe politickly caſt her Cards, that both might have a good hand, yet deald her ſelf the Trumps; checking their power, that they might not check hers.</p>

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> we muſt underſtand was now at liberty, and freed from the unjuſt Sentence againſt him in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, which was for ſome pretended Fact, but indeed was for his Religion ſentenced to be executed; but the Kings death prevented it.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecret deſign of the <hi>K.</hi> and Council to deſtroy the Proteſtants is almoſt diſcovered in this cleer and pretty Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note>There was in the Court of <hi>France</hi> at this came one <hi>Monſieur de Lignoroles,</hi> a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a ſharp and accute wit, attended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with a high and bold Spirit, which Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s great Familiar, which reaſon, together with the neerneſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to each other, the Duke did impart to him the ſecret Counſels of the King, with this Plot of cutting off all the Proteſtants, by a fair pretence of an alluring carriage, till they were under his power and mercy.</p>
               <p>This young Gentleman by his great inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with the Duke, grew alſo into high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King and Queen Mother, and for his wit and carriage, drew the eyes of all the Court towards him; attracting great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem from King, Queen Mother, and Court. This unfortunate Gentleman, more happy in the imployment, than wiſe in the improvement of his parts; who being in the high Road of Honour, wanted but few ſteps to a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, which time, and his wiſe mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would neceſſarily have courted him with, and conferred on him, This Gentleman (I ſay) hapned by his great eſteem to be admitted to the preſence of the King and Nobles; and once on a time when many Nobles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were preſent with his Majeſty, through ſome occaſion of a Treaty for a peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of freedom of Religion according to the Edict.</p>
               <p>At this time the King was highly moved with the Proteſtant Nobility; this young Gentleman, ſeeing the King angry, preſently ſtepped to the King, and whether to pleaſe the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170274:74"/>King, or to let his Majeſtie know he was thought worthy of counſel, by the great truſt ſome had put him in, or moved by ambition to appear no ſtranger to the Kings neareſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſies, which ſometimes in young wits many times runs before a diſcreet conduct of their advantages; But he (I ſay) whiſpers in the Kings ear, <hi>Deſiring his Majeſty that he would pleaſe to ſilence his mind, with a patient forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of anger, and to ſmile away their inſolency and folly, for his Majeſty well knew that few days would ripen their deſtruction, and lay them level to juſtice, which ſaies he, by a ſecret policy of your Majeſties great Wiſdom and compleat contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, was almoſt brought to a full concluſion laſt meeting; and which no doubt in the end will ſpeedily, and ſecurely, render your Majeſty in a full and ample capacity to be avenged on their haughtineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King at theſe words ſtartled within himſelf, being touched at the quick to have ſuch a ſecret imparted to one that was not of the conſpiracy, whoſe raw retention might prove fatal to them all; wondering how, and by what means, he ſhould come to the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Now the King in whom lodged a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge beyond his years, diſſembled his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at this time, and made no ſhew of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that might tend to the underſtanding of his ſpeech; but ſpeedily retired to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with a mind full of anxity and fury, and preſently without any delayes examines the <hi>Count de Retz,</hi> who denies that ever he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing to any or to him; he then char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Queen Mother, who anſwered ſhe was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170274:74"/>not to learn of him to keep ſecrets; at laſt he fell to examine the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it, and fell to perſwade the King, that it was as ſecurely locked from any further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as in his own breaſt; and like a Spring lock would ſhut but not open of it ſelf; That his Majeſty need not fear that any ſecret impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Ligneroles</hi> ſhould ever come neerer his mouth than his heart; the King anſwers, <hi>No more it ſhall, and I wiſh it had never come there, for I ſhall take order that he ſhall not have time to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the King calls <hi>George de Villequier, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of <hi>Guerchy</hi> (whom his Majeſtie knew ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ligneroles</hi> perfectly) and commanded him to uſe his Diſcretion for a ſpeedy removal of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> out of this world, and to put off the effecting his deſire no longer, and that day to bring to paſs his pleaſure, and command, without fear or delay, which with the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of another, was accordingly done; as ſoon as the King heard hereof, he was ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry, and commanded the <hi>Vicount,</hi> and <hi>Count Charls</hi> his aſſiſtant, to be impriſoned in the Palace, but in a Months time, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of <hi>Monſieur de Angoleſm,</hi> as alſo by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace and favour, they were ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

They enter his Lodging, kill all they meet with: The Admirall riſes, goes to prayer, and commands his Servants to ſave their lives by flight: They get on the tops of houſes, but are perſued and ſlain: They thruſt the Admirall through the body, beat him on the head, ſhoot him with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, and wound him the third time, whereof he dies, his body thrown out of the window, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> kicks him on the face with his foot: They cry out Kill, Kill, this is the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: The Alarum bell rings to a ſad and generall Maſſacre: The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls head cut off and ſent to the Pope: All in the Admiralls lodging murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, among whom two young children of honourable birth: Brave Count <hi>Rochfoucault</hi> baſely murthered: The Admiralls Son baſely ſlain, his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant fights gallantly for his life, but is

               <p>Now we ſhall further ſee the Kings diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and treachery; for the very ſame day the Admiral was thus wounded, does the King (the more neatly to colour his own act of treachery, with ſmooth pretences) write Letters to Embaſſadours of Forein Princes, and Letters alſo to the Governours of all his

               <p>The Queen Mother did alſo write letters to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtian Reader, when thou peruſeſt the whole ſtory, then wilt thou be able to judge of this deep Hypocriſie before ehe face of God, and as it were againſt the face of Heaven!</p>

               <p>Now this was a bait that took off all ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for alas who could ſuſpect or imagine this to be out of any treacherous intent, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of care and reſpect? but Oh ſad and helliſh plot under the vizard of friendſhip! theſe poor Noblemen, Gentlemen and brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders that might have eſcaped from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, are intangled and allured into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtreet, as into a fold or narrow path of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; no way to eſcape the fury of their Enemies rage and cruelty.</p>

               <p>For now in <hi>Paris</hi> the Priſons that had any Proteſtants (by which reaſon they eſcaped for a time) were now brought forth, and baſely ſlain by the multitude of murtherers, in which were three gallant Gentlemen of great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.

               <p>And thus died this bleſſed Servant of Chriſt in the heigth of their cruelty, and his Spirit full of Chriſtian magnanimity.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe many murthers in <hi>Paris</hi> was <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> ſlain; a man famous for learning, being the Kings Profeſſour in <hi>Logick,</hi> the bloody Murtherers breaking into the College of Prieſts, they baſely maſſacred him, then caſt him out of the chamber window, that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels with the fall, iſſued out on the ground, to a ſad view of all tender hearted Spectators, then was his body dragged through the ſtreets, and by certain yong Schollars whipped, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do it by their Popiſh Tutors.</p>

               <p>Thus dyed this young man and old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and may ſtand as a pattern for our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Two Miniſters belonging to the King of <hi>Navar</hi> were alſo murthered, and thrown into the River; but all the reſt of the Miniſters of Gods word, were by a ſingular and ſpecial hand of Gods Providence preſerved and kept from the rage of theſe bloody Tygars.</p>
               <p>There was in this City a Gentleman, whom the Murtherers found a bed with his Wife, who was then nigh her time of delivery, they no ſooner knock, but poor Gentlewoman ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the door to theſe bloud-hounds, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtab her husband in his bed; now the Midwife ſeeing them bent on blood, earneſtly intreated them to ſpare her, at leaſt till the Child was born, this being the twentieth child that God had given her, but their bloody minds admitted of no mercy, but preſently truſt a dagger up to the Hilt into her fundament, this poor ſoul feeling her ſelf mortally wounded, fled into a Corn loft to ſee if God would
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170274:102"/>pleaſe to bring the fruit of her womb to a birth, but theſe villains perſued her and ſtabbed her in the belly, whereof ſhe preſently dyed, then they threw her body out of the window into the Streets, which fall forced the child out of her body, with the head formoſt, gaping and yawning for life, in a ſad, doleful and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, and ſo it died.</p>
               <p>One of theſe villains ſnatching up a Little child in his arms, the child began to play with his beard, but inſtead of compaſſion this baſe murtherer had ſuch a flinty heart, that he wounded it with his dagger, and ſo caſt it in a goar blood into the River.</p>
               <p>But this bloody Maſſacre at <hi>Lyons</hi> cannot be paralleled by any age, the bare narrative will cloy and Reader at firſt view; Oxen and ſheep could not be deſtroyed with leſs pitty and more cruelty, than thoſe poor Proteſtants of all ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and degrees, from the Cradle to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid: Indeed its the moſt aſtoniſhing and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible murther that ever Chriſtian heard or read of.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170274:102"/>multitude of them, they are diſperſed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral priſons; <hi>Mandelot,</hi> the bloody Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Commanded the common Executioner to take aid to him, and deſtroy them all; but he, having his conſcience ſmit with pitty, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He was an Executioner of the Law, but not to put to death without law; he put to death all ſuch as the world was witneſs to their publick condemnation, and ſo deſired <hi>Mandelot</hi> to ſeek ſome that might better diſpence with a bloody conſcience.</p>
               <p>This cruel Governour having his deſire fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by an honeſt refuſal, commands the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were garriſoned in the Caſtle to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them; they reply it conſiſted not with their honour to deſtroy men in cold blood, and too cowardly to cut the throats of thoſe that had not wherewith to defend, being a thing too far off from valour, or the part of a true Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to deſtroy men at mercy, lying ſupplyant before them, nor ſaw they any cauſe why death ſhould be inflicted upon poor innocent ſouls.</p>
               <p>Dear Lord, what Proteſtant heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to read this ſad and lamentable murther without thought of revenge, who has a ſpark of Chriſtianity that can read, and not wiſh himſelf able to revenge their cauſe, only God is the Avenger of the cauſe of the innocent, and doubtleſs God has a Scourge for this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>Theſe Butchers of innocent ſouls, inſtead of pitty, for ſport cut of their fingers, and tops of their noſes, and then fell a murthering; throughout the City was ſuch doleful noiſe of the dying, and lamentable howling of women and children, that all thoſe that were zealous in the Romiſh Religion, abhorred their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, and had their hearts ſo peirced with the ſad groans of the dying, that they thought they were devils that onely had human ſhape, or that they were Indian Tygars, or wild beaſts only had aſſumed the ſhape of men; nay many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Popiſh Religion that were with child, and now nigh their time of Delivery, were ſo affrighted with theſe ſad cruelties, that they parted with child; The murthers and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre was ſo great that out of one of the priſons called the Arch-biſhops houſe, the blood of the ſlain was ſeen running down the ſtreets in the day time, in great abundance to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horrour of all the Beholders, for it run warm and ſmoaking hot through the ſtreets and ſo into the River.</p>
               <p>Amongſt them that were butchered in this Priſon, was an antient man, named <hi>Francis de Boſſu,</hi> a Merchant that had to his Sons two Religious young-men, whom he had carefully trained up in the fear of the Lord: As ſoon
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170274:103"/>as the Murtherers approached with their Axes, he exhorted his Sons, Not to fear death, for it was but a quick paſſage to their Fathers houſe, for that through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of God; for it has alwaies been, and will be to the end of the World, the lot of all Gods people to be as ſheep among wolves; if we ſuffer with Chriſt we ſhall alſo reign with him, this ſhort cut of ours will be, but as a Bridge for our more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſſage to eternal life; let us joyfully follow this company that is gone before us; and ſo the old Chriſtian and aged Father imbraced his two young Sons, and they him, with mutual embraces, and held ſo faſt together, that with the Murtherers blows they fell all flat to the ground together, crying to the mercy of God, and thus with many wounds was the godly Soul, and his two Sons cruelly murthered, by theſe bloody Butchers, and which is not to be forgotten, Theſe three bodies along time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were wonderfully knit together, which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſad ſight to the Spectators.</p>
               <p>After all theſe cruelties were done, <hi>Mandelot</hi> the Governonr commanded to be proclamed, that no man ſhould commit any more mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that if any one would diſcover any of the actors of ſuch horrid villainyes, they ſhould be rewarded with a hundred Crowns for their information; but alas, this was in a baſe, ſcornful and diſdainful way, for from that time they ceaſed not to kill and murder all they knew had eſcaped the common deſtiny, and on Sabbath day morning thoſe poor Proteſtants that had eſcaped their fury, was now by order of this baſe and bloody <hi>Mandelot,</hi> deſtroied and hewen in pieces.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:170274:104"/>
               <p>Theſe bloody Villains paſſing through the Streets with their bloody Inſtruments, boaſted that they had died their white Doublets with the blood of the Proteſtants, one bragging that he had killed an hundred, ſome more, ſome leſs: On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were ordered to be thrown into the River, but a great part of them <hi>Mandelot</hi> ordered to be boated over to the other ſide of the River, and laid on a green bank, neer to an Abby na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Eſne;</hi> and there the people came and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their bodies: and one thing (for the like was never heard of) is not here to be omitted; The Apothecaries viewing the bodies ſaid, they uſed to make medicines of mens greaſe; and being there were many fat bodies, there might be monies got, and ſo wiſhed the Butchers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them their greaſe, and they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, the bloody fellows ſpeedily chooſe out the fatteſt, launched them with their bloody Knives, and ſold their fat for three ſhillings a pound. So at laſt their bodies were ſome thrown into a great pit, the reſt into the River.</p>
               <p>The people inhabiting on the borders of the River, admired to ſee ſo many dead carcaſſes come down, having their bodies baſely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, ſome with eyes out, others their noſes, hands and ears cut off, and ſtabb'd in every part of their bodies.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Popes Legat arrived at <hi>Lyons,</hi> who coming out of the great Church from Maſs, the bloody Murtherers of ſo many innocent Chriſtians kneel down before him for abſolution, and as ſoon as the Legat was told who they were, and for what they kneeled
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170274:104"/>down, he made the ſign of the croſs, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved them of their ſins whether they repented or no, and doubtleſs theſe bloody Devils were canonized at <hi>Rome</hi> for Saints.</p>
               <p>The Kings Letters and commands coming to <hi>Coſſet</hi> the Kings Atturney at <hi>Meaux;</hi> he forthwith ordered thoſe of his bloody crew to come to him, who accordingly at ſeven a clock at night came, and received Orders to ſhut up the City Gates; at which time alſo they went through the Town doing nothing all that night but murther, kill and diſtroy the poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; in the morning they apprehended two hundred, and committed them to priſons; <hi>Coſſet</hi> comes to them, and having a Catalogue of their names, he calls them out one by one, and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthers as many as they could, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary they went to ſupper, and after a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment they returned again, and now they brought quicker Inſtruments of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Axes, and ſo fell again to call them out by their names, and butchered them moſt cruelly, amongſt whom was a godly Elder of a Church, who praying for his Enemies, they reviled him, and having on a buff Coat, they fearing it ſhould be ſpoiled with blood, did open it before and ſtabb'd him in the breaſt, whereof he died. Amongſt theſe alſo thus ſlain was an antient Gentleman Sheriff of the City, whom they cruelly handled, for firſt they cut off his noſe, and privy members, then thruſt him often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, toſſing him up and down, that at laſt he fell down dead, crying out to God for mercy.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the ſpeedy poſt with the Kings Letters came to <hi>Troyes,</hi> the poor Proteſtants
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170274:105"/>were quickly impriſoned, the Bayliff Summons the Keeper of the Priſon, who being ſick ſent one <hi>Martin</hi> to know his pleaſure, the Bayliff told him all their Priſoners muſt be ſlain; and ſo commanded a pit to be digged in the Priſon that the blood might not run down the Streets, now the Jaylor and his bloody aſſociates going to murther theſe poor innocent ſouls, no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaw them, but their conſciences gave back, ſtanding amazed at the horridneſs of their task, and ſo return, but the Bayliff got them, and filled them ſo full of wine and ſtrong drink, that without any fear or danger they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and called them forth by their names, he that came out firſt had a chearful countenance, and calling on the name of the Lord he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Breaſt and was killed preſently; the next that came, being ſeveral times wounded with a Halberd, and not killed, did at laſt cheerfully take the Halberd by the point, and put it to his breaſt, ſaying, <hi>Here bloody Murtherer, here, right at the heart, right at the heart,</hi> and ſo was thruſt through and died. All the reſt were cruelly murthered, and caſt into a great pit on the back of the Priſon; and although ſome were not quite dead, yet they caſt them in, one of theſe poor Souls having more life than the reſt, roſe up in the pit above his Fellows, but was preſently ſmothered with Earth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was a pit digged in the Priſon to ſave the blood, yet ſuch was the effuſion of Chriſtian blood, that it run out of priſon ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down the Gutters of the ſtreets, to the amazement of the Popiſh Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But now at <hi>Orleance,</hi> the place of the laſt Treaty of peace, and the place where it was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170274:105"/>ſolemnly proclaimed with full command for Obſervation of the Edict. At this place, I ſay, the Kings Letters came, commanding to murther all, and happened to come the ſame day that three hundred were met together at a Sermon, whereupon the Maior and Officers commanded the Companies in arms to fall on, and to execute ſpeedily the Kings command, oh Tyrant, and bloody command! One of the Murtherers went to a noble mans houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting himſelf, and his bloody followers to Supper, where they were made welcome with good chear, no ſooner was Supper ended, but they blaſpheming murthered him, and all his family, and then plundered his houſe.</p>
               <p>There were many that lived on the outſide of the Town, amongſt whom was heard ſuch ſad murtherings, and cruelties, that all night long was heard nothing but howlings and cryings of men, women and children maſſacred, ſhooting off of Guns, and Piſtols, breaking doors, and rumbling of Carts that conveyed away the dead bodies, all which were mixed with the cryes of the bloody Murtherers, crying Kill, Kill them all, and then take the Spoil; and thus they continued all the week in theſe ſad and bloody murthers, and plundering, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly ſinging in ſcorn, where is now their God.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday they came to a Doctor of the Civil Law, who being found in earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, they had not the power to kill him, only took a little plunder with them, next day they came again, and views his Library, what books they demanded he gave them, they told him he muſt be killed, he therefore goes to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170274:106"/>again, and afterwards deſired of them that if he muſt dy to murther him there, which they refuſed, they take him and lead him through the Streets, and coming to the Schools he deſired them to kill him where he taught ſo many; but they led him a little further, and ſo knocked him on the head. One that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by hunger out of a ſecret place where he hid himſelf, was preſently ſlain. Such as for fear revolted, they forced to kill their friends or were killed themſelves.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Kings bloody Meſſage came to the City of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> the Gates were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhut, but it pleaſed the Lord of his good grace and Providence ſo to order it, that the Proteſtants were gone that morning out of the Ciry to a Sermon, and as ſoon as the noiſe of the Maſſacre came to their ears, many returned not again to the City! But others would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo far as to go to order their affairs for a Return, but poor ſouls they never returned back, for as ſoon as they came to the Gates they were ſuffered to enter, leaving their ſwords at the Gates, amongſt whom was many of great account, and on wedneſday morning all the poor Proteſtants were impriſoned, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that none ſhould on pain of death hide any of them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe were ſix Counſellers; which like good Chriſtians encouraged the reſt: at laſt they were all brought into one place, and ſo the bloody Murtherers being ready with axes and knives they were one by one deſtroyed, their bodies ſtripped naked, and lay for two daies; The ſix Counſellours being hung up in their long Gowns upon Elm Trees in the Palace
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170274:106"/>yard; which would move any one to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there being in this City three hundred thus murthered.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Roan</hi> as ſoon as the Kings command came, there was an infinite number ſlain in few daies, ſix thouſand men beſides women, whom they uſed as cruelly as can be imagined, their bodies were ſtript and caried out in carts, being put into the pits in great heaps.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as ſoon as the news of the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> arrived, and command from the King to follow their Example. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were boating over the River to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but orders followed them that they ſhould be apprehended, whereupon the Gates of the City were ſhut, yet the Miniſters through Gods good mercy and grace eſcaped, and ſafely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>England.</hi> The Governour was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what timerous to act the Kings command in ſuch a bloody ſubjection to cruelty, but the Lord <hi>Monpeſſat</hi> aſſured him, how acceptable it would be to his Majeſty, and for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement he enters the houſe of the Lord of <hi>Obiers,</hi> and baſely murthered him in his own Court.</p>
               <p>And then preſently the froath and Scum of the Town, aſſembled and murthered all the reſt, amongſt whom was a Miniſter that came out of the adjacent Countrey, Alſo there was a reverend old Deacon of a church whom they dragged out of his ſick bed through the Streets, and ſo baſely and inhumanly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the bloody Meſſage of the Kings cruell command arrives at <hi>Angiers,</hi> they fell on all the Proteſtants without mercy or pitty,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170274:107"/>to ſex or age, for no ſooner were the Maſſacres begun at <hi>Paris,</hi> but one <hi>Monſorel</hi> a bloody and cruel Papiſt, poſted and ſoon arrived with orders from the K. to deſtroy all; he no ſooner arrives but deſires a ſpeedy conduct to one <hi>Maſſon de Rivers,</hi> who was a Godly and zealous Paſtor of a Church; a very able and elaborate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſer of the Myſteries of the Goſpel; and one excelling in wiſdom, knowledge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; He it was that laid the foundation ſtone of the firſt Church of Chriſt in <hi>Paris:</hi> This bloody <hi>Monſorel</hi> meets Mr. <hi>Maſſon's</hi> wife at the Door, and kindly ſaluted her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding where her Husband was, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Garden, whither ſhe conducted him, who as ſoon as he commeth to him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces him kindly, ſaying doeſt thou know my meſſage, and the buſmeſs I come to thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, it is (ſaid this villain) to kill thee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, for the King commands it; and ſo preſents a Piſtol to his Breaſt, Maſter <hi>Maſſon</hi> replyed, I know not wherein I have given his Majeſty ſuch cauſe; but one thing Sir I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg at your hands, to give me ſo much ſpace as to commend my ſoul to God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which as ſoon as he had ended, this cruel and mercileſs Tyger piſtoled him.</p>
               <p>And ſo this faithful Servant of Chriſt fell dead at his feet.</p>
               <p>Not long after, arrives another bloody Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger from <hi>Paris</hi> by the Kings Order, who drowned many, amongſt the reſt, was the virtuous wife of this Godly Miniſter of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Maſſon:</hi> a Chriſtian getting into an obſcure place of a Rock, the entrance being narrow, was, after he got in, covered with a

                  <p>THe King prolaims pardon to all thoſe that had eſcaped in Woods, and Rocks, who no ſooner comes home, but treacherouſly deſtroys them all, in a moſt cruel manner.

A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is called, and Proclamation is made that all murthers ſhould ceaſe. Many gòes to view the body of the Admiral hanging on the common Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. The King and Queen Mother goes alſo; but his body over night was ſecretly taken away and buried: ſo they loſt their journey.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170274:109"/>according to the Original, which gives much light to the Hiſtory, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers how Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> reſented the Murther, with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pitty and Diſlike of the whole <hi>English</hi> Court. Theſe cruelties ſpotted the <hi>French</hi> Nation with a great Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um among Forein Princes. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> his Letter to his Wife inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the Plot diſcovered. The King notwithstanding his former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts granted, and Oaths to keep his Promiſes, does now proclaim, that none ſhould exerciſe any Religion on pain of Death, but the Romiſh. A form of Abjuration ſent to thoſe that would come in, and forſake the Proteſtant Religion; and when they did, they were murthered contrary to the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation: A true Copy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of the King to all his Lieutenants, and Governours of his Provinces, with a Copy alſo for Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw when all was murthered that could very well be laid hands on, and the King underſtanding that divers Proteſtants, had in many parts of the Kingdom fled, and left their Habitations for ſecurity of their Lives; He
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170274:109"/>acts the ſecond and worſt part of his Deviliſh Treachery and cruelty; for after many ſweet baits of inticing and alluring promiſes for them to come in, he at laſt publiſhed Letters, and ſent Meſſengers;</p>
               <p>Wherein he ſhewed, The great grief it was to him that ſo much blood ſhould be ſpilt in the Nation, contrary to his will, promiſing to puniſh the Actors of ſuch horrid villainies, with as much crueltie as Juſtice could inflict, and they deſerve. And that if the Admiral, and his Aſſociates. deſerved the death inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their treaſonable practices, yet was it no reaſon ſo many innocents ſhould bear part of this puniſhment, that had no hand in the Plot.</p>
               <p>Now many poor Proteſtants that had left all, and fled into the woods, being encouraged by theſe inticing and fair pretexts, returned home, eſpecially they that had fled from <hi>Diep, Roan,</hi> and <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> now we ſhall ſee the King like a Thorny Buſh to the poor ſheep, that in a ſtorm they run to ſhelter, and inſtead thereof are intangled, and their wool pull'd off their backs. But oh wretched Tyrant, and worſe King! whoſe furious and bloody mind, like an impetuous Whirlewind, or Hiricane, could not be kept in bounds, but ere two daies paſt he impriſons them all, and appoints baſe fellowes to murther them, with cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And thus for thirty daies together was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but horrible ſlaughter throughout the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> inſomuch that there were about a hundred thouſand little Babes, Widdowes and children wel-born that father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170274:110"/>and Motherleſs, lived long in wandering, and beggary.</p>
               <p>And truly that reverend and faithful Servant of Chriſt, did not miſs the Mark of the Kings treachery and perfidious dealing, when he made this Anagram on his name;</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CHARLES VALOIS,</hi> Anagram, <hi>Chaſſeur deſloyall,</hi> i. e. <hi>Perfidious Hunter or Perſecutor.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>In this calamity many that would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their lives among their own friends, could not have the favour, nay their own parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them, others betrayed by their friends, and yet it pleaſed God to move the hearts of ſome of their Enemies, by their high deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe cruelties, and villainies, inſomuch as they hazarded their own lives to ſave ſome of the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Was ever ſuch unheard of cruelties permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commanded by any Chriſtian King, and Court with ſuch delight of ſhedding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant blood; We may ſay of the <hi>French</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the caſe here ſtood) as the poor. <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtory ſtands recorded thus.</p>
               <p>A Prince of the <hi>Indians</hi> being ſo far wrought upon as to receive baptiſm at the hands of a Fryer, he firſt queſtioned, whether the ſouls of ſuch as were baptized went? Anſwer was returned, To Heaven; then ſaies he, whether muſt they go too that are not baptized; They anſwer, To Hell; but he further demanded,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170274:110"/>To which of theſe two places the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went? Anſwer is returned, To heaven, then ſaid the <hi>Indian,</hi> Let me go to Hell if the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> go to Heaven; for I cannot believe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be a good place, that is a reward for ſuch bloody Butchers; and Maſters of ſuch unheard of cruelties. May we not ſay ſo of this ſad Maſſacre of <hi>France?</hi> but I leave the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the judicial reader.</p>
               <p>The King now fearing the Diſhonour of falſehood, treachery, and perjury, and that it might not fix any reproachful blot, or ſtain on the Kings name; This King at the ſame time that he ſends Letters through <hi>France,</hi> giving in command to cut off and deſtroy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, the ſame King with the ſame hand, and at the ſame time, ſends Letters to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Provinces; wherein he lets the world know that the late miſchief in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> had to his great ſorrow hapned by means of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who having raiſed the people, they tumultuouſly broke through the Guard, which he had appointed for the Admirals ſafety, and with great Fury killed the Admiral and his Friends, and that he with the Queen Mother and Brethren, were through the danger of a furious multitude, forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for ſafety to the <hi>Lour,</hi> all which he ſaid was againſt his mind and will, and therefore he deſired the Edict of Pacification to be kept inviolable.</p>
               <p>The like Letters he writ to <hi>England, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> which becauſe they bear one tenure, and pen'd after one manner, I have to avoid prolixity, incerted only this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter.</p>

                     <p>YOu have perceived what I wrote unto you Yeſterday, concerning my Couſin the Admirals wounding, and how ready I was to do my endeavour to ſearch out the truth of the deed, and to puniſh it, wherein nothing was left undone or forgottou. But it hapned ſince, that they of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and other Lords and Gentlemen their Adherents, (whereof there be no ſmall number in this City) when they certainly knew, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals friends would proceed to the revenge of his hurt, and becauſe they were ſuſpected to be the Authors thereof, were ſo ſtirred up this laſt night, that a great and lamentable ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aroſe thereof, inſomuch that the Guard by me appointed for his defence about his Houſe, was ſet upon, and he himſelf with certain of his Gentlemen ſlain, and havock of others made in divers places of the City, which was handled with ſuch rage, that I could not uſe the remedy I would, but had much ado to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Guards, and other Defence, for the ſafety of my ſelf, and my brethren in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the <hi>Loure,</hi> to give order hereafter for the appeaſing of this Sedition, which is at this hour well appeaſed, thanks be to God, and came to paſs by a particular and private quarrel of long time foſtering betwixt theſe two houſes.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170274:111"/>Whereof when I foreſaw that there would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; ſome miſchievous purpoſe, I did what I could poſſibly to appeaſe it, as all men know, and yet hereby the Edict of Pacification is not broken, which I will to be kept as ſtraitly as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was, as I have given to underſtand in all places throughout my Realm, and becauſe it is greatly to be feared that ſuch an execution might ſtirr up my Subjects, one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cauſe great murthers through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Realm, whereby I ſhould be greatly grieved, I pray you cauſe to be publiſhed and underſtood in all places of your Government that every perſon abide and continue in the ſafeguard of his own houſe, and to take no weapons in hand, nor one to hurt another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death; commanding them to keep and diligently to obſerve our Edict of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to make the Offenders and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſuch as would diſobey and break our will, to be puniſhed. You ſhall aſſemble out of hand as great force as you can, as well of your friends as of them that be appointed by me and others, advertiſing the Captains of Caſtles and Cities in your Government, to take heed to the ſafeguard and preſervation of the ſaid places, ſo that no fault enſue on their behalf, advertiſing me alſo as ſoon as you can, what order you have given herein, and how all things have paſſed within the circuit of your Government. Hereupon I pray God to keep you, Couſin, in his Holy ſafe-guard.</p>

               <p>Now at the ſame time, were Orders given
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170274:112"/>out by the King, for all Towns and Provinces within his Power, to follow the example of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and to murther and put to death all of the Religion, and the very next month he wholly aboliſhes that famous Edict, giving command to root out all the Proteſtants both from Eſtates and Places, and at laſt as we ſhall ſee, cauſes a Form of Abjuration to be made, and cauſing it to de proclaimed, That no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be exerciſed in the Kingdom but the <hi>Romiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we ſee by theſe Letters that the King would fain lay the blot of this foul crueltie to the antient Quarrel of the houſes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> therefore the <hi>Guiſans</hi> foreſeeing the foulneſs of the fact, ſtrove as much to evade the dint of the Diſhonour, as the King did, though the <hi>Guiſans</hi> were the Plotters and chief Agents in the practical part of this cruel Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy; whereupon they handled the matter ſo, that the King was forced to acknowledge, and avow publickly this horrid act, and indeed none more fit than the King that commanded it. And truly the ſad effects of theſe unheard-of cruelties, would make any one diſown it, and gladly would the King don ſo, for he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the effects, and now could neither evade the diſhonour, nor Gods juſt Judgements. But he is not yet ripe for them; although in theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſſacres he had not ſpared, but baſely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be butchered, an infinite number of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Noblemen, and Young Ladies, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of learned men, many reverend old men, many young Gentlewomen and Virgins, many honourable Matrons of good account, women with child, and little infants at their mothers breaſts.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170274:112"/>
               <p>Now the King being forced, to let the world know his perjury, and cruelty, he labours to ſet a good face on his cruel heart, ſo that the King that had the four and twentieth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1572. declared by Letters to all the Provinces and ſeveral Princes abroad, that the tumult in <hi>Paris,</hi> aroſe betwixt the two parties of the <hi>Guiſan</hi> and Admiral; now but two dayes after, being the twenty ſixth of the ſame mouth, This moſt mighty King (and by conſent of all nations commonly called) the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, comes into the Parliament, with a great Train of his Brethren, and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of his Court attending him, where in a full Aſſembly of his Council, he aſcends the Throne, and ſitting thereon, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects his Speech to this great Aſſembly in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings Speech in Parlament</note>That having been informed, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral with certain of his confederates, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his favors, &amp; gratious pardons granted to their former Rebellions, yet have now plotted againſt my perſon, with my mother and Brethren, to our utter perdition, which being diſcovered, I was forced to prevent my own ruin, by Juſtice to procure theirs, and by a ſpeedy courſe, have heaped on their own heads what they would have heaped on mine. For this cauſe therefore it was, that by my command the Admiral and his Complices, are deſervedly cut off, hoping thereby, that a period is not only put to their Treaſon againſt my ſelf, and Nobles, but alſo to future troubles, which would have fallen on this poor Nation, to an utter ruin thereof.</p>
               <p>Now although at firſt, he had both by words
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170274:113"/>and Letters, laid the whole Buſineſs on the fury of a popular tumult, headed by the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Guiſans,</hi> yet now at this time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking his Deſign, he diſcovers himſelf like his actions, and now laid down his Reaſons and grounds of this manner of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Rebells, as he calls them; and ſo further declared,</p>
               <p>That he thought it not altogether unfit to make his Magiſtrates acquainted with it, That what was done at <hi>Paris</hi> in the late Slaughters, was by his own commandment, for the ſafety of his own life, and national tranquillity, and alſo that they might proceed with the like ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, againſt ſuch Traytors, and Rebells of ſuch a wicked Conſpiracy, and that it was a ſudden thing, and not premeditated (a deep reach to take off the edge of ſuſpition) hapning in a manner, ſaies he, by chance, and not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plotted contrivance.</p>
               <p>This Speech of the Kings, was by himſelf, and the Parliament commanded to be written, and entered into the Records of Parliament, proclaimed by Heraulds, and publiſhed in print, a Book alſo was publiſhed by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (which becauſe it is within four daies of the ſame date of that Letter, wherein he laies the blame of the Admirals death, &amp;c. on the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and here takes it to himſelf) therefore I ſay I thought fit to inſert that printed Book by way of Declaration, which is as followeth.</p>

               <p>There was Letters alſo writ by the King to the Officers of Burghs, alſo remembrances ſent to the General Lieutenant of Burgundy, which being to the ſame purpoſe, is omitted for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>The Kings Oration, in the great Aſſembly aforeſaid, being ended; before this Aſſembly broke up, one <hi>Chriſtopher Thuane,</hi> the Preſident of this Aſſembly in Parliament, being one of a high Spirit, and ſubject to admire his own parts and actions, ready to wonder what a fool he could make of <hi>Solomon,</hi> being a man repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170274:115"/>to be notable for his light brain and cruel heart, who truſting more to a ſlipery tongue, than a ſound cauſe, congratulated the King for his wiſe Policy and good ſucceſs in a ſpeedy conqueſt over his Enemies.</p>
               <p>But alas! how did he conquer? Only by wearing the veſt of the Innocent, to conceal and cover the deformed uglineſs of his perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perjury.</p>
               <p>But the Advocate of the <hi>Finanees</hi> ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered his mind to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That though his Majeſty had juſt cauſe to puniſh Delinquents, yet it were more becoming the juſtice of a Prince, to proceed according to the Lawes by himſelf decreed and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſo more fit for his Majeſty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſpeedy ceſſation of ſuch violent ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to enter upon a judicial proceeding, according to the Laws, which was well known to be the proper and peaceable eſtabliſhment of Empires and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>This advice takes well, for now the King begins to do unjuſtly in the name of Juſtice; ſo he proceeds to diſſemble a Legality for all his future Butcheries, unwilling to murther any more without a ſtatute, and pretence of Juſtice for it.</p>
               <p>This being a brave principle of a Tyrant; and that whereas the Laws at firſt were known to be the legitimate daughter of judgement, it muſt now be made the adopted daughter of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Now is an arreſt of Parliament, with his Royall aſſent, ſo that immediately Heraulds went about the City, and an Edict was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the Kings name, That all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170274:115"/>ſhould ceaſe; but thoſe that he intended more immediately to have a hand in himſelf, by ſitting in judgement and quallifying his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bloodſhed, with the name of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>And firſt let us ſee a little of this new Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Kings, which now muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the dead Admiral, which being as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, hung by the heels on the common gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of <hi>Paris,</hi> the people by flocks and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes gathered to ſee it.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother, to delight her ſelf with that ſad v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew of her Sons and her own bloody cruelty, ſhe takes the King and his Brethren, and ſo advances towards this ſad ſight, but his body was in the night conveyed away by two of the Marſhall <hi>de Momorancies</hi> Servants, and was ſecretly buried at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> whoſe faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and adventure is beyond a terrene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>And now the King begins to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the adviſe of the Advocate; being alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it by <hi>Morvilleir,</hi> a wicked fellow, and the firſt that brought the Prieſts into the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> now it was thought fit to bring to publick Juſtice, thoſe that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken flying and hiding themſelves, and ſo after the uſual manner of Judicial proceedings, ſhould be examined by choſen Judges cull'd on purpoſe, and ſo by Sentence condemned, that in view of all the world, they might receive their execution as the effects of juſtice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of there Treaſonous practices.</p>
               <p>The Judges thus appointed, was <hi>Birage, Thuan, Limege</hi> and <hi>Belleuxe;</hi> who preſently gave order for a man of Hay made in ſhape of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170274:116"/>a mans body, and ſo to perſonate the Admiral, whom they had murthered; and ſo it was dragged through the ſtreets by the <hi>Boreau,</hi> his memory was condemned and razed out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, his arms and Enſigns of Honour and Chivalry demoliſhed, his Caſtles and Farms razed to the ground, his Children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced infamous, and unnoble, and all the trees in his woods to the growth of ſix foot to be cut down.</p>
               <p>And now to make way abroad in the World, in the Court of <hi>Forein</hi> Princes and Nations for a more neat excuſe to their unheard-of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; They diſperſe Libells full of diſhonour to the Admiral, and his Adherents, and ſtuft with the Defamation of their memories, and that their Actions might not run in a Line Antartick to their words, The King diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his <hi>Grand Provoſt</hi> with all diligence to ſeize upon the Admirals wife, and <hi>Mounſeir de la Vall</hi> the Son of <hi>Andelot</hi> deceaſed, who by Gods good Providence were already fled to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova,</hi> and the better to eſcape further danger, went to live among the <hi>Switzers</hi> in the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Bearn,</hi> the younger Children both male and female were condemned to death in their tender years.</p>
               <p>They give alſo new charges to their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, negotiating in <hi>Germany, Poland, England, Switzerland,</hi> and other <hi>Forein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> to juſtify the actions of the King and Catholicks, tending alſo to the Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ſhame of the Admiral and his Friends.</p>
               <p>But God uſed theſe things afterwards as a further mean to diſcover their treachery, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170274:116"/>ſo proved againſt their expected advantage.</p>
               <p>For had the King and Court of <hi>France</hi> declared at firſt that they deſigned to cut of their Enemies, as the exuberous branches of the Kings indulgency, and now grown his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hy their plotted treachery, this would have excuſed them from perjury and treaſon, but to pretend that they intended not what they really reſolved to do, and nothing leſs than what they did, This I ſay was the height of diſhonour to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus died that famous, Religious, and Noble Commander <hi>Gaſper de Colligny</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Proteſtant Army and cauſe, for the ſpace of twelve years; whoſe deſerved Fame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with great renown in the hearts of all the Godly, and with no leſs terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often filled the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe valour purchaſed great merit from his Enemies; He that made the King and Court afraid, in a haſty and diſorderly retreat from <hi>Meaux</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> And that I may add one mite to the Treaſure of his true worth, this is he that many praiſed and all admired, that through a wiſe conduct of his affairs, terrified his boiſterous Enemyes, to a ſubmiſſive calm of ſubjection; A man ſo inſpired with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and conſtancy, that to take a Deſcription by any pen, would be the higheſt road to lay his merits in the grave of obſcurity, being a man full of the ſail of valour and ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſtar of the greateſt magnitude in the affairs of higheſt importance, ſhining for ever in the loweſt obſcurity of diſcords, ſudden dangers, and inſurrections. One that cannot be enough admired, commended or honoured,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170274:117"/>being above all a man of profound judgement in point of reality. This being the leaſt part of honour that is paid to his eternal worth by all that knew him. He, he it was that baſely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the unreſiſtable ſhock of a perfidious, and treacherous death, cowardly murthered by thoſe that durſt never draw a Sword with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of valour againſt this Champion, but trembled at his Remembrance and Preſence, who was never overcome by valour but by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the reſt that were brought to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal murder. was one named <hi>Caviagnes</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Requeſts to the King, and one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Briquemault,</hi> both inward friends to the Admiral, and in great reputation in the Court of honour and Camp of Chivalry.</p>
               <p>Now this brave Commander and old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Briquemault,</hi> having great renown by his ſervice under King <hi>Francis,</hi> and King <hi>Henry,</hi> was therefore honoured by all but ſuch as love no Rivals, nor valued any crueltie if they could but out ſhine others loyalty, by their own treachery. This brave Gentleman was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourſcore and ten years old, and poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had gone through too much proof of fidelity, now to end his life under the command and protection of ſuch a cruel Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Now theſe gallant Commanders aged with experience, and filled with innocent integrity, were like Lambs before Wolves, threatened to be torn in pieces unleſs without delay, they would with their own hands ſubſcribe that they were of the Admirals Councel, to cut off the King, by an untimely death; together with the Queen his Mother and his Brethren,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170274:117"/>and promiſing pardon, if they would accept of it; Theſe innocent Gentlemen cryed out, That they were ready to ſuffer the Torments of their mercileſs cruelty upon their bodies, rather than pull down vengeance upon their ſpotleſs ſouls, ſo humbly beſeeched the King to ſpare his torments, ſeeing none could peirce ſo far as force themſelves to a falſe accuſation, yet if his Majeſty pleaſed to totment their bodies, they hoped God would ſo in his mercy order it, as to leſſen the pain thereof by his gratious preſence in their ſouls; in whoſe goodneſs they hoped to depend for aid, rather than perjure their own Souls by a falſe accuſation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others, being as full of innocency and integrity as they of cruelty and perjury; they were reſolved never to accuſe murthered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, wherein they never were guilty, nor commit ſuch an execrable crime as the King requeſted; and (ſay they) though the King va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues the tranquility of his Realm before the blood of Chriſtians; yet we hope to embrace a peaceable conſcience, in trampling underfoot the high eſteem of a tranſitory poſſeſſion; for what will it gain us to gain our lives and loſe our immortal ſouls?</p>
               <p>The Judges having ſome remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, began to deny the embracement of that infamy,<note place="margin">The Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges toucht in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to fit in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which muſt juſtly fall on their unjuſt Sentence; for indeed their reaſons were unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtable; and theſe Judges underſtood the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the King by the Defendants Pleas, ſo they refuſed any more to hear, or determine, much leſs to give Sentence, whereupon were new Judges appointed in their room, and to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170274:118"/>them was joined a Tormenter, and Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as might ſuit with them, ſo at laſt theſe eminent and brave Cammanders and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were by a ſhadow of Law, and illegal Legality, condemned to dy, and ſo the 22. of <hi>October</hi> 1572. in the fight of the King, Queen, Mother, her Sons, with many thouſand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on them, they were led to the gallows, ſeated in the prime ſtreet of the City, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore execution, as <hi>Briquemault</hi> aſcended the Ladder, came to him the under Provoſt of the Town, whom the King had commanded to inſinuate into him and to profer pardon for life, if he would confeſs what was laid to his charge, ſaying further, that his Majeſty being of an eaſie nature, and courteous affability, would as ſpeedily grant pardon, as he ask it, but he, like one truer to his own ſoul, then the K. to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, replyed, That it was the K. duty to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God, if the day of Gods mercy had not paſt upon his cruelty and perjury, and ſo was far from asking forgiveneſs for that, whereof God and his ſoul were witneſſes of his innocency, yet to prove himſelf as good a Chriſtian as the King a ernel Tyrant, he cordially deſired God of his great mercy to forgive the King. And ſo lifting up his eyes to heaven, he uttered theſe Words, Oh my God, upon whoſe Tribunal ſeat I ſtand, and whoſe face I hope ſhortly to ſee, thou knoweſt well that I know nothing, nor did not ſo much as once think of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the King, nor againſt his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; though I ſtand charged with the ſame in my proceſs, but I beſeech God to pardon the King, and all thoſe that have been the cauſe of this my unjuſt death, even as I deſire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170274:118"/>at thy hands for my ſins, and offences committed againſt thy Divine Majeſty; ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending another ſtep of the Ladder, he onely ſaid, I have ſomwhat to utter to the King, which I would be glad to communicate unto him, but (ſaies he) I ſee that I may not; and ſo ſhrunk up his ſhouldiers, forbearing to uſe any further ſpeech; ſo theſe two brave Gentlement were at laſt with halters about their necks, moſt baſely, unjuſtly and diſhonorably thrown off the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Hangman; whoſe deaths ere this are accounted for; and as <hi>Briquemaults</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy was much commended, ſo was his death much bewailed by many Catholicks, that were ſpectators of this ſad crueltie.</p>
               <p>Two things was very ill ſpoken of by the Catholicks and Proteſtants; firſt the preſence of the King, as a thing unworthy the Head of Juſtice, to ſee the Execution; Secondly, That <hi>Briquemault</hi> being a Gentleman of Good deſcent, was baſely hanged, being a thing rare in <hi>France,</hi> but eſpecially now in regard he was reputed of his Enemies to be free from the charge for which he died; about an hour after this unheard-of Juſtice and execution the bloody Catholicks of <hi>Paris,</hi> drew their bodies through the Streets, thruſt their dead bodies through with daggers, ſhooting of dags at them, cutting off their ears, and omitted no other kind of cruelty, and barbarous villany that could be imagined.</p>
               <p>And thus the Noble Gantlemen, by their Chriſtian Moderation and compoſedneſs of mind, reared Trophies of Honour out of the Ruins of their own misfortunes, <hi>Et Miſerias infularum loco habuere,</hi> wore their diſaſters like
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170274:119"/>holy veſtments as robes of honour, They let the world know they could not only do but ſuffer, and that paſſive fortitude is as good as active valour, <hi>Et facere &amp; pati fortia, hoc</hi> Romanum <hi>eſt, L. Flo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to perfect all, they likewiſe with theſe two famous Gentlemen, cauſe to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man of ſtraw made for a ſhadow of the Admiral.</p>
               <p>Theſe barbarous cruelties, ſtrange Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and unheard-of perjury in theſe bloody proceedings againſt the poor Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> brought an odium and bred a Hatred from Stranger Princes, but eſpecially in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> likewiſe did much fruſtrate the <hi>French</hi> Negotiations in behalf of the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Courteous Reader, ſince the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of publiſhing this ſad Tragedy, there came in the interim a book to my hand; wherein is ſomwhat diſcoverd of this Hiſtory, but ſpecially the reſentment and judgement of Sir <hi>F.

So is the Journeyer ſlain by the Robber, ſo is the Hen of the Fox, ſo the Hind of the Lion, ſo <hi>Abel</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the wicked, ſo <hi>Abner</hi> of <hi>Joab:</hi> but grant they were guilty, they dreamt Treaſon that night in their ſleep; what did the innocent men, women and children at <hi>Lyons?</hi> what did the ſucking children, and their Mothers at <hi>Roan</hi> deſerve at <hi>Cane?</hi> at <hi>Rochel?</hi> what is done yet, we have not heard, but I think ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhall hear; will God, think you, ſleep ſtill? will not their blood ask vengeance? ſhall not the Earth be accurſed that hath ſucked up the innocent blood poured out like water upon it, &amp;c.—I wiſh you were out of the Countrey, ſo contaminate with innocent blood, that the ſun cannot look upon it, but to prognoſticate the wrath and vengeance of God. The ruin and deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not come till all Chriſtians were either killed there, or expelled thence.</p>

                              <pb n="230" facs="tcp:170274:129"/>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſence and interpretation of the holy Doctors received by the ſame, rejecting all other interpretation as falſe and erroneous. I acknowledge the ſeven Sacraments of the ſaid Catholike, Apoſtolike and <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> that they were inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that they be neceſſary for the ſalvation of mankind, although that all of them are not of neceſſity to be confererd on all, that is to ſay, I confeſs that the ſaid ſeven Sacraments are theſe, Baptiſm, Confirmation, Euchariſt, which is the Sacrament of the Altar, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Marriage. And that the ſaid Sacraments confer grace, and that of them Baptiſm, Confirmation, and Order cannot be reiterated without Sacriledge. That the ſaid Sacraments have the effect which the ſaid Church teacheth, and that the form and uſage wherewith they be miniſtred to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is holy and neceſſary. I acknowledge alſo that the holy Maſs is a Sacrifice and Oblation of the very Body and Blood of our Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, under the form of bread and Wine mingled with water, which ſubſtances of Bread and Wine under the ſaid Forms (are in the Maſs by the words which ſerve for conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, ſaid and pronounced by the Prieſt) tranſubſtantiated, and transformed into the Subſtance of the ſaid body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Notwithſtanding that the Qualities and Accidents remain in the ſaid Forms, after the ſaid Conſecration, and that the Maſs is wholeſome and profitable, as well for the quick as the dead; I acknowledge the concomitance, that is to ſay, that in receiving the body of Jeſus Chriſt, under the form of Bread alone,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170274:129"/>I likewiſe receive the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. I confeſs that prayer and interceſſion for ſaints, for the quick and the dead is Holy, good and Helthful for Chriſtians, and is not contrary (for any reſpect) to the glory of God; That Prayers made in the Church for the faithfull which are dead do profit them for the remiſſion of their ſins, and leſſening of their pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred for the ſame. That there is a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where the Souls abiding, are ſuccoured by the prayers of the faithful. I confeſs that we muſt honour and call upon the Saints which reign with Jeſus Chriſt, and that they make interceſſion for us to God, and that their Reliques are to be worſhipped. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Traditions, of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, Apoſtolike, and Romiſh Church, as well they which pertain to the form and ceremonies of Divine ſervice, and to aſſiſt the ſame, which I think are to draw Chriſtian People to Piety, and turning to their God, as Faſting, abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from meats, obſervation of Holy Dayes, and Eccleſiaſtical Policy, according to the tradition of the Apoſtles and Holy Fathers continued ſince the Primitive Church till this time, and afterwards brought into the Church by the Ordinances of Councils received in the ſame of long and Antient time, or of late, be good and holy, to the which I will and ought to obey, as preſcribed and appointed by the Holy Ghoſt, that the Author and Director of that which ſerveth for the keeping of Chriſtian Religion, and of the Catholike, Apoſtolike and <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I believe alſo and accept all the Articles of original ſin, and of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. I affirm aſſuredly that we ought to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170274:130"/>have and keep the Images of Jeſus Chriſt, of his holy Mother, and all other Saints, and do honour and reverence unto them; I confeſs the power of Indulgence and pardons to be left in the Church by Jeſus Chriſt, and the uſe of them to be very healthful, as alſo I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſs the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Mother and Chief of all Churches; and conducted by the Holy Ghoſt, and that other pretended particular inſpirations againſt the ſame, come of the ſuggeſtion of the Devil, the Prince of Diſſention, which would ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Union of the Myſtical body of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World. Finally, I promiſe ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep all that was ordained at the laſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and promiſe to God and you never more to depart from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, Apoſtolike and Roman Church, and if I do (which God forbid) I ſubmit my ſelf to the penalties of the Canons of the ſaid Church made, Ordained, and appointed againſt them which fall into Apoſtaſie.

               <p>Then thoſe poor ſouls that were fled into Woods, Rocks and Mountains to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from his bloody Fury, he allured into a Net of Deſtruction by a Proclamation of Liberty, Eſtates and Lives, and they were not come home above two days but by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand baſely and unworthily murthered.</p>
               <p>And whereas he publickly declared, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed liberty to the Proteſtants, according to the Edict of <hi>Pacification,</hi> now we ſee he publickly decrees no Religion to be exerciſed but the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, on pain of death.</p>

                  <p>SOme few Remarks on the perfidious Treachery in this ſad Maſſacre; Fourty thouſand poor Proteſtants cut off in few dayes. The moſt ingenuous Papiſts whiſpered of this perjury and treachery of the Kings; Compared with other cruelties, but holds no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the vildeſt; Theſe poor Proteſtants cut off by the Oaths and Promiſes of a King, enough one would think for the ſtrongeſt ty of ſecurity. Examples of the like cruel Treachery and perjury, condemned by the light of Nature, and ſeveral Examples of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, worth the ſtudy and peruſal. The great and high eſteem of an Oath amongſt the Heathens in a few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; So few Examples of Gods juſt Judgements on ſeveral Princes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170274:131"/>that have broke Truce, Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Promiſes and Oaths, which are collected out of Scripture and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. The Brave Examples of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, worthy our Imitation in this Sunſhine time of the Goſpel; though they had but the Light of Nature, yet they ſoared above the preſent practice of many Christian Kings, nay beyond the Practice of many Profeſſours in theſe latter Dayes. The Duties of Kings and Powers of the World, which is not inconſiſtent with prudent Policy and ſound Christianity. The many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of Cruelty and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; The little ground of ſuſpition of the Admirals Plots from ſundry ſtrong Arguments.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt me a little comment on this ſad Hiſtory, and draw out ſome Chriſtian Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this Tragedy, to ſhew what judgments God juſtly inflicts on ſuch villanies, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, being ſuch heavy ſins as pull down Gods vengeance, not only on themſelves, but the place, even to the third and fourth Generarion. And now let this ſad, doleful, and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Maſſacre be erected in view of all the World, let it not be forgot by any tract of time; Let it ſtand on a hill as A beacon on fire, to all true Proteſtants, to take heed of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170274:132"/>peace with ſuch faithleſs men, that have no way to enſlave their Enemies, but a treacherous and deceitful peace. Diſdain it not that it is old, I could wiſh every age would renew it, That it may be ſet as a Land mark to avoid the Diſtraction of ſuch Treacherous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Princes and Nations, as know no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, but what is lodged in the outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and not able to keep that neither; ſuch as know not what is the meaning of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of heart, unleſs it be courteſie and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and know not that neither, ſuch as have no hearts but their Tongues, which they tip with peace, but intend Treaſon in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To what can we parallel this unheard-of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, had it been amongſt Heathens, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Turks, it had been the leſs to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at;<note place="margin">Bellum Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> I have read of many cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the <hi>Tartars;</hi> The King once for one mans fault deſtroyed a whole ſtreet and killed, even men, women and children, not ſparing women with child.<note place="margin">Cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, yet ſhort of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </note> Another time there was a whole Legion of men cut off for one mans fault; for another mans fault he cauſed twenty thouſand to be killed. Half his Army revolting, the reſt retired to him, like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſengers with the News, and tells him the reaſon why they went not on in a ſucceſsful progreſs to the performance of the Deſign he ſent them about; yet this Tyrant cauſes his Army to cut them all off to the number of fourteen thouſand; he tyed ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand by their hands and feet together, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be cut off. Now all theſe cruelties were not to be tainted with either perjury, or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170274:132"/>breach of promiſe, and if it had, it was by a Heathen; but our cruelty and blood-ſhed is by a Chriſtian King, to his own Subjects, in a baſe Treacherous way, contrary to Oaths, and Covenants before the Eternal God, by a King and Nation that had ſo much of the Heatheniſh darkneſs diſperſed that we cannot ſay but they were Chriſtians according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, though not according to practice.</p>
               <p>Nay had their cruelty and murthers reached no further than to thoſe they ſay had plotted againſt them, and ſo deſerved it, then had it been better excuſable, but why ten thouſand Innocents in one day, and thirty thouſand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, all as ignorant of Treaſon, as the King and Nation guilty of blood and perjury; why ſo many poor Innocent Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, poor Ladies and Gentlewomen, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, aged perſons, ſick, children, innocent of actual ſin, all muſt dy to quench the blood-thirſtineſs of this King, Oh! ſade and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conſider.</p>
               <p>Nay further, had it been in a ſudden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable and mad outrage, of a popular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, guided by the fury of their own fancies; But it was by the Kings ſpecial command, they had no other light to guide their bloody zeal, but the Kings Authority, which they ſo often mentioned, as the Eccho reached Heaven, but could not peirce their pitty, and done by plots and Contrivances, premeditated and reſolved to be done.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, had it been in a time of War, to cut off ſo many poor innocent Souls, it might alſo been ſomwhat pardonable, a raging Sword, ſometimes knowing no bounds, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170274:133"/>when in bloody Hands. But all was done in cold blood, not in a ſtorm, or heat of blood, nay the only time was in peace, and nothing to be ſeen but favours, and acts of Grace; poor Proteſtants they were catched in no net, but pretences of Peace, and the fulleſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of affections, that might be, nay it was done alſo contrary to Promiſes, Covenants and Contracts, making a Mariage to defile it with blood, no other intent being wrapped up in that wedding but a plot for blood.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſad and lamentable Spectacles of mans wrath, and the Devils policy, how can it but peirce the very hearts and Souls of all Godly Chriſtians, nay I dare ſay of ingenuous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who cannot but abhor the thoughts, and mourn to ſee ſuch a bloody Tragedy acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Theatre of a Chriſtian Kingdom by the Treacherous plot, unheard-of perjury, and down-right command of a Chriſtian King?</p>
               <p>When we ſhall conſider the ſad ſlaughters of ſo many of Noble blood, many gallant young Gentlemen, with many young Ladies, that came to attend and compleat ſo ſeeming and promiſing a harmony of Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both parties, in the mariage of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Margaret,</hi> and King of <hi>Navar;</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo how many poor innocent infants, and ſilly ſouls, were baſely murthered by the hand of abject and forlorn fellows; That its credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly written by good Authors, that there could not be ſo few as fourty thouſand ſouls cut off in few days by this ſad cruelty and Maſſacre.</p>
               <p>I find it alſo recorded by good Authors, that many men of quality, who were both Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the moſt ingenuous Papiſts, whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170274:133"/>of this cruelty and falſhood, ſo clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the King in his ſpecial commandment. Hiſtories cannot be produced to parallel this cruelty; The bloody command of King <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> who with a Letter and Meſſenger put to death one hundred and fifty thouſand <hi>Roman Citizens</hi> that were all ſcattered in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts about their Merchandize. This I ſay cannot reach this Kings Treachery, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The Tragical Hiſtories of the K. of <hi>Spains</hi> Murthers in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> though they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in number, yet not in the nature of the offence; although it is recorded, that in ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, he deſtroyed ſix Millions of poor <hi>Indians,</hi> roaſting ſome, throwing others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to be devoured of wild Beaſts, yet cannot it come near to our ſad ſtory.</p>
               <p>We may compare it to <hi>Silla,</hi> who by a baſe Proſcription, in one City caſt out four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſeven hundred Citizens, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one hundred and fourty were Senatours; and not long after, the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> proſcribed three hundred Senatours, and two thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, and many other crueltyes. And as <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> ſaid of theſe cruelties, ſo may I well apply it to theſe ſad diſaſters, <hi>Cum quibus tandem victuri ſumus, in bello armatos, in pace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The ſame <hi>Silla</hi> after he had given his Faith, for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of four Legions of his Enemies, for all they implored his mercileſs trechery for favour and pitty, yet he commanded them all to be cut off.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:170274:134"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> which deſtroyed eight thouſand <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Iſland of Sicily,</hi> is but a flea-bit to this cruelty.</p>
               <p>Many other examples of cruelty might be uſhered in upon the Stage of Obſervation, but what ſhould we do with any more, unleſs we could bring one to parallel it? which by the narroweſt ſearch into all Hiſtory I think can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done.</p>
               <p>Indeed none of theſe I have named can fix on the borders of this Cruelty; they did it againſt their Enemies, ſome of them againſt a forein Nation, but this King <hi>Charls</hi> againſt his own Subjects, and under the peaceable protection of a Loving King, as they thought. Thoſe Tyrants owned their bloody acts, and gave reaſons for it; but our King <hi>Charls</hi> hid his cruelties in the boſom of his Councils, and varniſht them ſo with fine-ſpun pretences; that all he did looked not like what he ſaid, till God would not let it be hid, but forced him to confeſs it to all the world.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants never could be got to yield to his Power, but his faith and promiſes; which they depended upon, as a ſure ſtaff, and prop to lean upon in all times of diſturbance and tumults; elſe would their force and valour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſtooped to his rotten faith, and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red promiſes; we ſee his promiſes and Oaths were linked together like Ropes of ſand; he intended not to ty himſelf by the moſt ſolemn Oaths, and Engagements, but Others muſt be tyed to their Ruin by them.</p>
               <p>What unworthy waies and means this King took (unbecoming the Majeſty of a King) to feed his cruel and bloody heart, making uſe of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170274:134"/>the mariage of his own Siſter, as a bait to this horrid villany; and ſo abuſed the mariage bed with a bloody Tragedy, beſprinkling her wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Robes with blood; which indignity and diſhonour, no Nation under the Sun, either of former, or of the ages ſince, can forget or paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell.</p>
               <p>It is a piece of ſuch baſe Treachery, as we ſhall ſee condemned by the practice of heathens that had only the light of nature; it is ſuch a ſin as God often times repaies with his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>Thus we ſee what heavy Judgements God has made, and does execute, upon all ſuch as are contemners and breakers of this holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and Law of God; The Lord is to be feared and obeyed, for in all his Judgements none greater threatned, nor heavyer and ſurer falls on, than on bloody and perjured men. A thing abhorred and hated by Heathens, before ever they were ſo far enlightened as to know the Law of God was above the Law of <hi>Nature;</hi> for though they had but the light of Nature, yet they held it a ſin unpardonable, and no Puniſhment accounted enough, as they could invent.</p>
               <p>There were ſome that recorded theſe cruelties and treacherys of the Kings, and inſtanced the Law of the twelve Tables. <hi>Si patronus clienti fraudem facit ſacer eſto,</hi> if the Sovereign cheat his Subjects, let them be out of ſafety or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>He that in antient time deſpiſed the keeping of Oaths, was no more to be called a King. The Right hand was called a Pledge of Faith; The Throne is eſtabliſhed by Juſtice, and it is an Abomination for Kings to do wickedneſs: The Throne is upheld by mercy ſaies <hi>Solomon,</hi> But this King by his Treachery, Perjury, and Cruelty, degraded himſelf of his peoples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for he valued not the lives of many thouſand, ſo his bloody cruelty could be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> accounted it an honourable thing to ſave one Citizen, rather than to kill a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Enemies. There was no power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <p>But indeed it is the manner of Murtherers to bereave of life without Law, or cauſe of death. Nay had this horrid Maſſaere been a bare down-right murther, it had been the leſs; but it was covered with fraud and deceit. The King and Court muſt perſonate a Religious habit, and pretence of a Religious vow, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods holy Ordinance ſtoop to his deceitful and tteacherous intention.</p>

                  <p>A King ought by his Chriſtian demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have a rich ſtore-houſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer of Affection, and allegiance in his peoples hearts; and he, who takes care therein to lay ſuch proviſion of love, as that it may be as a firm Rock, as a ſtrong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, what is there then that he may not command, which is in their power to perform, then the arms of the peoples affections open, and are ſpread to imbrace any command; this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170274:139"/>is the way to have the key of their hearts, and to open that treaſury of reſpect; which by the wiſe mannagement of his power (received from them) he hath ready laid up.</p>
                  <p>Loving Subjects are moſt uniting in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious conſent of obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; love to a Prince created by himſelf, will make cowards valourous, even to defend him from the ſhock of his Enemies aſſaults: And it is ſeen with greateſt luſtre, and to his beſt advantage in his Straights, when he hath made all his Subjects on the leaſt notice, ready to be voluntiers in the greateſt dangers, and hotteſt attempts for the Honour of their own Prince.</p>
                  <p>But when Kings ſpend too much on the ſtock of his Peoples willing minds of Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and prodigally trade away that ſtock of Love treaſured up in his people, what does he but expoſe himſelf to all aſſaults of fury and cruelty, without pitty? as it has been the end of many Princes; nay when love is abuſed and turned to hatred, in what a tottering Throne does he ſit?</p>
                  <p>But whatſoever the Theory of an abſolute Monarchy be, yet a Good King loves the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part of Juſtice, his Power being more ſafe in his Laws than his Will. Though his power and his Command may claim a ſtrong Authority to do as he pleaſes; yet he will not make his Power arbitrary, nor beyond the limit of equal juſtice to all.</p>
                  <p>Now for Oppreſſion, Tyranny, Cruelty, and perjury, to be ſeated in the heart of a King, and he in the heart of his Kingdome, Oh!
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170274:140"/>how it levells his peoples affections, and ſtems the tide and current of their allegiance, razes the very foundation of his own ſecurity, and is the moſt compendious way to his own utter ruin.</p>
                  <p>It doth by a ſtrange inſtinct, raiſe tumults, and viciſſitudes, that like a rapid Torrent of confuſion, falls upon his own head, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his vicious merits.

                  </p>
                  <p>But this King to eſtabliſh his Throne of Cruelty, and Tyranny; Peaceable like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troaths his People and Himſelf, in an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble bond of Peace, never to be broke on his part, yet no ſooner made before the view of heaven, and in the ſight and preſence of God, but he regiſters his falſehood, cruelty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in a ſuddain breach, with the blood of his own Subjects, taking the advantage of their punctual obſervance, to diſarm them, and take their Towns, which on the peace granted were delivered; and ſo erects his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Engines of deceit upon the ruins of his own promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſtian Reader let us a little ſee the ſmall probability that the Admiral ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt what they pretend; which reaſons, for general ſatisfaction, I ſhall gather together; becauſe it is declared by the King, that it was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170274:140"/>for a Plot againſt him and the Court, although it is clear, that it was reſolved on by the King, Queen Mother, and Cabinet Council, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Admiral and his Friends; which by the Kings Commandment is lamentably, and wofully effected, to the great diſhonour of the King, and the whole French Nation, and cannot but ly as a blot to after ages; and a time there muſt be to ſatisfy God and the World for it.</p>
                  <p>Now who can imagine, that the Admiral ſhould think with a few Gentlemen allowed for his Guard, to attempt any thing againſt the King, within <hi>Paris,</hi> there being in the Court conſtant watch, and at the entrance to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, a ſtrong Guard of <hi>Scots, Switzers,</hi> and <hi>Gaſeoins,</hi> and was then more ſtrictly kept in regard of the number of Lords, Noble-men, and Gentlemen, met to ſolemnize the mariage of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> and that it is well known that in three hours ſpace, may be ready at command, ſixty thouſand men in arms.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe Reaſons, the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen that came with the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> had no other arms than their Swords and Innocency; which latter in the greateſt danger would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them beſt.</p>
                  <p>And yet further to clear all doubts, the Princes and Noblemen of the Proteſtants, for a Pledge, and Teſtimony for a Solemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of their innocency, they brought with them, their Wives, Siſters, Children and Kinſwomen, having no thoughts of any
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170274:141"/>thing but Triumph and Recreation; The Nobles and Gentlemen intending to ſhew their expert skill at the Tilt and Tourney.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be ſaid it was after the Admirals Hurt, that he ſtudied to be revenged.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, With what probability can any ſober mind, imagine or conceive that the Admiral lying wounded on both arms, tyed up, and hourly waiting when one Arm ſhould be cut off by the Doctors adviſe, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, I ſay, being Guarded by the Kings own Guard, ſhould attempt with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen of his Guard, to ſurprize the King, &amp;c. being ſo ſick as few daies was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to paſs over, till God would call him to himſelf, that any ſhould think three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſo reſolute as to ſet upon a City wherein was ſixty thouſond in Armes by the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum?</p>
                  <p>But doubtleſs had ſuch a thing been known or ſuſpected, he would have been ſecured by <hi>Coſſin</hi> and his men, who had by the Kings commandment environed and beſet him; how ſoon might the ſick Admiral been apprehended as well as murthered?</p>
                  <p>There was never any thing laid to his charge which could be proved by the leaſt witneſs, nor what they laid to his charge, had the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, place, adherents, means, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that if it had been proved or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King ſhould have proceeded according to Law and Juſtice, which are well known to be the props and Pillars on which a Kingdoms happineſs ſtands ſecure.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe we that all theſe things had been
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170274:141"/>really true, and that the manner of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals death and his Complices had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable by all nations, yet let us conſider a little, and demand a reaſon of the inſolent cruelty, infamous barbariſm, and unheard-of bloodſhed, of thoſe, that were thought by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves altogether innocent of any plot, being antient Matrons, many Noble young Ladies, and Gentlewomen in the flour of their Age, cut off ſo baſely and barbarouſly, a number of women great with child, againſt the Law of nature were caſt into Rivers before the time of their Delivery; many aged perſons alſo which lay ſick in Bed, Many Counſellours, Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, Proctors, Phyſicians, &amp;c. that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted only with their books, and the reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered from the conference of any Counſel, by the Sex and degrees; Why was there alſo ſo many learned Teachers and Profeſſors of the Arts and Sciences; amongſt whom was <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> that famous man for learning through out the world, who ſtands in the memory of the truly learned, as really, as theſe bloody actours render <hi>France</hi> infamous? How many young Students, without hearing or pleading their cauſe, were here deſtroyed by this ſad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the King and Council?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, what Armour was found, what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons was found in any of the Proteſtants hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which means ſuſpition might grow to proof? Or why was the Kings Letters ſent to command the like murthers at <hi>Meaux, Lyons, Troys, Tholouſe,</hi> and all over his Dominions, ſuch ſlaughters were committed till the very blood of Gods ſaints made the Rivers ſwell, and ſtreamed through the ſtreets reaking hot,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170274:142"/>that at leaſt 40000. were ſlain by his bloody command.</p>
                  <p>Thus has this King and Court imbrewed their hands in the blood of ſo many thouſand innocent ſouls, even to the great expectation of ſome vengeance, which in Gods due time muſt needs break out on that land, to the third and fourth Generation; if a General repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance do not expiate this deſerved puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſtian Reader, to bring this Kings reign to a cloſe, I ſhall only abſtract the moſt notable paſſages together, which hapned after this ſad Maſſacre.</p>

                  <head>The Contents.</head>
                  <p>THe Proteſtants that eſcaped this ſad Maſſacre, fled to many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Some ſet forth Books of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and bloody cruelty; Others flie to divers Towns and Cities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them; <hi>Rochel</hi> ſtrongly fortified; Fourty ſeven Ministers fly to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and eſcape; The King and Court keep a day of Thanksgiving for this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; The <hi>Rochelois</hi> refuſe a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſent by the King; The <hi>French</hi> King lets the King of <hi>Spain</hi> know the War againſt him was in jeaſt, as well as his Oaths and Promiſes. The <hi>Counts</hi> Army routed and ſpoyled by Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Monſieur de la Nove</hi> turns to the Protestants; The unparallel'd Siege of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> yet yielded on honourable terms; The unheard-of ſiege of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:170274:143"/>Yet had honourable Conditions granted. The Protestants fortifye and reſolve to ſell their Lives at a Dear Rate. The King takes <hi>Villars</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms not Covenant; The Proteſtants take in ſundry Towns; The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieges <hi>Sommiers,</hi> and with great loſs leaves it, and they beſiege it again, and take it on terms; The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieges <hi>Cauſſade,</hi> and with great loſs retires, the Proteſtants are encouraged by their good Succeſs; They Proteſt againſt the Kings last Edict contrary to the Edict of Pacification; Their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gallant Declaration: Their demands of the King, and deſire of Peace; The King terrified with their Reſolutions; The King recovers of a deſperate ſickneſs. A Parliament cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Proteſtant Deputies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to meee them, but no good done; A new Plot diſcoverod, Count <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> with his Fleet from <hi>England,</hi> is beſieged at St. <hi>Lo;</hi> he eſcapes in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is beſieged at <hi>Danfront;</hi> he yields on terms of life, but the King breaks Engagement, and baſely behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Concluſion of this ſad Hiſtory. The King dies wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170274:143"/>and rowling himſelf in his own blood; The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſucceeds to the Crown, but is juſtly murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> is murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Queen Mother broke her Heart and died.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter this ſad and lamentable Butchery and blood-ſhed, the poor Proteſtants that were eſcaped, fled with all ſpeed to the ſeveral Sanctuaries, which God in his mercy had decreed for their preſervation. Thoſe that inhabited upon the coaſt of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign, Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> which were Provinces lying on the Sea over againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They fled to Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and if occaſion offered, to fight under the command of <hi>Count Montgomery,</hi> who then was in the Queens Court.</p>
               <p>The poor diſtreſſed remnant of Proteſtants in <hi>Dauphine, Provence</hi> and <hi>Lyonois,</hi> fled into <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> amongſt whom was the Admirals ſons and <hi>Andelots,</hi> who by the fame of their Fathers Authority, and the tenderneſs of their years, were joyfully welcomed from ſuch a Land flowing with blood and vengeance.</p>
               <p>Some imploy their time and Talents in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth to the World in Writing this horrid Treachery and Maſſacre acted in <hi>France,</hi> and to let all the Proteſtants in other parts of the World beware by their ſad example: letting the World know the ſtratagem that the <hi>French</hi> Court uſe, is to deſtroy by Peace, and that to ſhake hands in a peace with Papiſts, is the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170274:144"/>ready way to deſtruction; the inſtance whereof was ſo freſh in their minds, that they needed no grand Jury of examples to inforce belief; their own late woful experience being ſufficient to teſtifie this for a truth.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Campagn</hi> fled to the Cities of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proteſtants in the heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and towards <hi>Rochel,</hi> flocked to ſome ſtrong Towns, which it pleaſed God of his goodneſs to reſerve for their ſafety, which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they fortified with all the ſtrength they could; They that inhabited in the Iſle of <hi>France, Nivernois,</hi> and <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Sancerre.</hi> Thoſe that lived in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoiny,</hi> placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Montaubon.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Guienne, Poictou, Zaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> fled to <hi>Rochel;</hi> which proved a ſafe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from the cruel Birds of Prey; <hi>Henry Jaques,</hi> Maior of the City, had the Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof. To this City alſo reſorted three thouſand five hundred men, and came from ſundry parts, which had been Souldiers in the Wars, and men of approved valour; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to their aſſiſtance came fifty Gentlemen of good quality from the adjoining parts about the City; there came thither alſo fifty ſeven Miniſters of Gods Word, which by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were preſerved in this ſad blow; and for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and other Proviſion, there wanted none to ſupply their neceſſity of a ſtrong and laſting ſiege.</p>
               <p>Now at laſt the King, Queen Mother, with his Brethren and Court, orders a Day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thankſgiving, to be returned for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170274:144"/>the good Succeſs againſt the Proteſtants. Thus they reared up Caſtles of Triumph to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſhonour, which practice is condemned by a <hi>Turk, Sultan Orchan</hi> ſecond, King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> when he had overcome the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Battail,</hi> word being brought to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe was demanded what ſhould be done to thoſe Priſoners that yet alive remained in their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whether they ſhould be killed or not? who more like a Chriſtian than a <hi>Turk</hi> replyed, Oh no, it is not the part of a Souldier to drown Mercy in Cruelty, for ſaies this brave <hi>Sultan, Mercy is the Alms of Victory,</hi> a noble ſaying of a Heathen.</p>
               <p>Now the King ſends <hi>Monſieur de Byron</hi> to <hi>Rochell,</hi> to place a Garriſon, the Proteſtants refuſe it; being a priviledge granted them by the King to receive no Garriſons; whereupon <hi>Byron</hi> proclaims a War againſt them. Poor ſouls, they had ſadly felt the ſmart of the K. perfidiouſneſs, by their too credulous opinion of theſe fair pretences; and therfore now thought good to preſerve their lives from Treachery, or dy with honour.</p>
               <p>And now to let the World know what little reality is ſometimes found in Princes; the King of <hi>France</hi> declares to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the war which he ſeemingly countenanced under command of <hi>Count Lodowick</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> was only a plot to bring about his ends; which as it could not be ſeen by all, ſo could it not but be believed by the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that the undertakers under <hi>Count Lodowick,</hi> were ſharply perſecuted by them that afterwards got power over them.</p>
               <p>Thus were theſe poor Souldiers betrayed out
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170274:145"/>of the Kings own Treachery. Only <hi>Monſieur de la Nove</hi> was preſerved ſecretly; who being ſafely conducted to the Kings Court, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty commands him to <hi>Rochel,</hi> to ſolicite the City to a Compoſition, Brave <hi>Monſieur de la Nove,</hi> ſtoutly, and like a Chriſtian, anſwers the King, That it was againſt his Conſcience to adviſe his fellow Proteſtants, to lay their throats open to them that would too readily cut them; But the King commands, and together with his ſecret deſire to ſee <hi>Rochel</hi> ſpurs him on, ſo having came to <hi>Monſieur de Byron,</hi> who was at <hi>St. Jean de Angeli,</hi> and after a viſit to him, delivering the Kings Meſſage, he enters <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi> who by a joint Conſent of all the City was choſen their Captain General, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted of it, and gave a good proof of his faithful adherence to the Proteſtant cauſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January,</hi> by the Kings Commandment, <hi>Monſieur de la Chastre</hi> with ſix thouſand men, beſieges <hi>Sancere;</hi> where finding a furious and reſolute Enemy, which would not yield to their Summons, after the expences of great toil and labour, diſcharging in two moneths about ſix thouſand Cannon ſhot, they made an aſſault, but were bravely repulſed to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal praiſe of the <hi>Sancerrois</hi> valour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The 18. of <hi>March</hi> by a ſecond bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery on all ſides, they at laſt made a great breach, and ſo aſſault and attempt to ſcale, but the beſieged (who queſtionleſs had many friends ſlain in the bloody Maſſacre) had ſome ſparks of their Friends blood in their minds, which then ſhewed it ſelf in their reſolutions; that they fall on the Enemy by a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and made not only a Halt in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170274:145"/>proceedings, but made them retreat with the loſs of ſixty of their beſt Souldiers dead in the ditch, two hundred mortally wounded, and two hundred utterly lamed; all with the loſs of ſeventeen men of the Proteſtants; which piece of valour ſo cooled the courage of the Kings Army, that they reſolved no more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to be made again ſuch impregnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants. So they begirt them cloſe on all ſides, no relief being able to come to them; which did ſo extreamly ſtreighten the beſieged, that they were forced to eat their Aſſes, Mules, Horſes, Cats, Dogs, Mice, Moles, Leather, and at laſt to eat parchment, and trappings of Horſes, horns, wild roots, Girdles, making bread of the ſeeds of flax, and herbs mixed with Bran, and of ſtraw and Nutſhels, they made uſe of ſlates, Greaſe, Tallow, and Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſerved for pottage, frying therewith the Excrements of Horſes and Men; nay the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry filth in the ſtreets alſo; ſuch as went out to ſeek relief, were either killed by the Enemy, or lived on Sprigs of Vines, herbs, red Snails and Blackberries; they endured all miſeries till fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine had imprinted old age on the Viſages of Children, ſo that the youths appeared like the Ghoſts of the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>Eighty perſons died by the Sword, but the famine deſtroyed five hundred. Some Souldiers and Townſmen, chooſing to caſt themſelves upon the Enemy, than dy by famine, adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out; whereof ſome were killed, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and others executed: The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſworn that he would make them devour one another, was diſappointed by a ſpecial hand of Providence, and a thing no waies expected
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170274:146"/>by the beſieged Proteſtants, who indeed look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a general Maſſacre according to the K. threats; who was reſolved to bring their houſes of a threatning height as low as their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their aſpiring reſolute minds, lower than them, reſolving to raze the City into a ſolitude, and to bury his Reſolution in their Ruin: but it pleaſed God that the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> this Kings Brother, being choſen K: of <hi>Poland,</hi> Ambaſſadours were comming for him, and by the way hearing of this ſiege, they earneſtly ſolicite the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> to perform his promiſe, for the Biſhop had ſworn in the name of the King his Maſter that all Towns moleſted for <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould be free. So the poor Town was ſaved from the fury of a bloody and cruel Enemy, and yielded on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to depart with their arms, bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, thoſe that ſtayed to be free from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion for what was paſt, with a promiſe to preſerve the Honour of women and maids.</p>
               <p>The King, with an Army of fifty thouſand men, and ſixty pieces of Artillery, beſieges <hi>Rochel</hi> both by Sea and Land. The Town was fortified ſtrongly, nothing wanting to annoy the Enemy, and encourage valor among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In one Months time was ſhot no leſs than thirteen thouſand cannon, and many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauls: But alas the Catholicks were too weak to encounter with the Proteſtants ſtrength and Courage. Till at length having endured ſome Moneths, the King, Queen Mother, Duke of <hi>Arjou,</hi> all the Nobles, with the Cavalry and all the Infantry both <hi>Swiſs</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> arrive to this famous ſiege the beginning of <hi>February</hi> 1572. of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, there was the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170274:146"/>Duke of <hi>Alancon,</hi> third Brother to the King, the Duke of <hi>Montpenſeir;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Mayen,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The Duke of <hi>Nevers, Bouillon, D' U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qes,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the Prince <hi>Dauphine,</hi> the Count of <hi>Manlevrier,</hi> Marſhal <hi>de Coſſe,</hi> the Baſtard, <hi>De Angouleſm,</hi> the <hi>Count de Retz, Monſieur de Moluc,</hi> and all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Commanders in the Civil Wars and Maſſacre.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rochel</hi> there was a great number of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Gentlemen, eight Companies of Inhabitants, nine companies of Strangers, one Company of the <hi>Mayers,</hi> one Company of Volentiers, conſiſting of twenty Muſquetiers, twenty five armed with Coſtlets of Proof, and thirty Harquebuzeirs; Two thirds whereof were Gentlemen and ſuch as had command in the late wars.</p>
               <p>The ſiege continued with great valour on both ſides, and great loſs to the Kings Army; which in the aſſaults made, and often ſallies, loſt the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> and <hi>Coſſin</hi> Field-Marſhal, who was the firſt that entered the Admirals lodging; an infinite number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Officers, with twenty thouſand Souldiers, and the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> wounded in the Neck, ſide and left hand by a Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzeir: but ſix thouſand freſh <hi>Switzers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſiege, did much ſtraiten the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> that at laſt having no hope of Relief, they grew in great want of Victuals, yet in their ſtraits the hand of good was wonderfully ſeen; for in the midſt of their wants, when all other proviſion failed, there came before the Haven an infinite number of ſmall fiſhes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170274:147"/>a great Supply in their needs. Which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſign of Gods goodneſs amazed them the more, becauſe it was never before, nor ſince that ever the like was ſeen.</p>
               <p>During this ſharp ſiege, the ſame occaſion happened now, as did at <hi>Sancerre;</hi> for the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Poland</hi> being come for the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> proved a relief for the <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> when they expected none. So Articles were agreed on both ſides, That there ſhould be a free exerciſe of Religion in <hi>Rochel, Montauban</hi> and <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and to other Towns to be in their houſes without ſearch, That Baptiſm and Matrimony ſhould be freely adminiſtred, not above ten perſons meeting together: and that thoſe that had a mind to ſell their eſtates might do it, and live where they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the two famous ſieges of <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Sancerre.</hi> Let us now obſerve a little the Tranſactions of both parties during theſe Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe ſieges continued, the other Provinces which the Proteſtants had in their power, they fortifie. The Baron of <hi>Serignac,</hi> a diſcreet and virtuous Proteſtant, and no leſs valourous, did with ſome others fortifie <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> and afterwards they advance into the Field with their Troops, and garriſon <hi>Terride,</hi> aſſault <hi>Buzet</hi> upon <hi>Tar,</hi> and many other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtrongly fortifies the Towns that they had kept during the Civil Wars; ſo at an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly held at <hi>Realmont</hi> in <hi>Albigeois,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſeparate to their ſeveral charges apart.</p>
               <p>A part of <hi>Quercy</hi> towards <hi>Cadenac</hi> was the lot of the Vicount of <hi>Gourdon;</hi> the Count of <hi>Serignac,</hi> governed towards <hi>Montauban</hi> and <hi>Gaſconie.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:170274:147"/>
               <p>The Viſcount of <hi>Paulin</hi> had the command of <hi>Lauragais:</hi> And the County of <hi>Foix,</hi> and the Mountain Country was under the command of Vicount <hi>Cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ont.</hi> Theſe Commanders reſolve to defend their ſeveral charges, to ſecure themſelves, as well as God would enable them; retiring all to their ſeveral Commands.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Villars,</hi> Admiral and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the King, gathers forces againſt the Proteſtants, takes in <hi>St. Geniz,</hi> and contrary to Articles carries the Lord of the Place away Priſoner.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants to ballance this loſs, takes in <hi>Foreze, Monteſquian,</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>Againſt the Proteſtants does the Marſhall <hi>de Anville</hi> appear in arms, claps ſiege to <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miens,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Candale</hi> brother to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall arrives to his Aſſiſtance, and ſtrengthens the Siege, who now with a reſolute charge aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Town, but meeting with a ſharp en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, were forced to as nimble a retreat, and that not without the loſs of 300. of their moſt reſolute Souldiers. After a months time, and five thouſand Cannon ſhot ſpent, the Marſhal by his Brothers perſwaſions to revenge the loſs of his Captains and Souldiers, ſet on a freſh aſſault, and having before his eyes loſt many of his men, fell on himſelf, but was as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly repulſed as aſſaulted. The Town now being ſtraitned, and their wals beaten down, yielded on honourable terms; after which the Marſhall ſeeing and conſidering the Proteſtants reſolutions there, and elſewhere, concludes it beſt for him to disband, which being done, he made ſeizure and ſale of the eſtates of thoſe Proteſtants, which lay within the power of his mercileſs cruelty.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:170274:148"/>
               <p>The King beſieges <hi>Cauſſade,</hi> and meeting with reſolution amongſt the Proteſtants, who did ſo waſt his Army, that the Kings Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral drew off, and perſued by the Vicount of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> in their March to the ſiege at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherepon the Proteſtants aſſemble in many places, &amp; ſettle the Countie of <hi>Montauban,</hi> orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that City to be their Principal ſeat, and in that County the Vicount of <hi>Paulin</hi> being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Governor of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> it was made the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſeat in the County of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which lay under the Government of <hi>St. Romain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe preparations and reſolutions thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſtrikes an arrow in the Kings heart, who now too late ſaw that all the blood he and his Council had ſhed, proved not as he expected; and now the horrour of ſo much blood fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bloody and guilty conſcience, inſomuch as he knew not which way to turn, once he was reſolved to fall on thoſe that had perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that the cutting off the Proteſtants would terminate his Troubles in a quiet calm and enjoyment of one Religion, and that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a period to the Proteſtant power would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate him in the throne of his full deſires. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while he would ſtop his brother the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and not ſuffer his abſence in ſuch a pinch of occaſions.</p>
               <p>But God will not now let blood go long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avenged, even on the prime inſtrument of ſuch wicked cruelty, thus ſtraightened on all ſides, he is ready to be oppreſſed with anger and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtranger Princes openly reproach him, for the irreparable injuries done to the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Proteſtants, and his too loyal Subjects,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170274:148"/>for a King, which ſhould be a Protector of his people, to prove a Tyrant, a cruel murtherer, and Butcher of his own Subjects. The King with anxity of mind falls into a deſperate ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at <hi>Vitry</hi> in <hi>Campagn,</hi> as he was ſetting forward his brother towards <hi>Poland,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers again: in the midſt of theſe actings, the Proteſtants of <hi>Languedoc</hi> fortifie themſelvs. Now the King to give ſome hopes to grant the Proteſtants their deſires, ſummons a Parliament to meet at <hi>Campagn;</hi> the Proteſtants in ſeveral Provinces prepare their Deputies with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and had it given them in Commiſſion, to ſpeak home, againſt the Authors of the late unheard-of cruelties, and murthers; the Q. Mother, and the reſt are afraid of the Touch, and ſo at firſt labour to pacifie the Proteſtant Commiſſioners with fair words, but that will not do, the Proteſtants muſt not play away their lives in an equal ſtake of fair words, the late woful experience of their murthered friends frighted them from putting too much truſt in theſe words; whereupon not receiving content to their juſt and honeſt demands; they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw to their ſeveral charges, and endeavour their own ſecurity and ſafety.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>Montgomery</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with his fleet from <hi>England</hi> in a part of <hi>France,</hi> called <hi>Le Payes de Conſtantine,</hi> a part of the Province of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who being ſafe landed had aſſiſtance from ſeveral Proteſtants, and ſeized on ſeveral Towns, as <hi>Danfront, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentane, St. Lo,</hi> and <hi>Valognes,</hi> but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had better ſucceſs in all parts than in this Province of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings Army under the command of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170274:149"/>Field Marſhall lay ſiege to <hi>St. Lo,</hi> wherein was the Count <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and all his ſhips lying under the command of the Town; the Count ſecreatly eſcaped from the danger of ſo weak a place, but <hi>Jaques Sieur de Martignon,</hi> with <hi>Villers</hi> and <hi>St. Columb,</hi> leave <hi>St. Lo,</hi> beſieged with a party under command of <hi>Fervagues,</hi> and <hi>Malicorn,</hi> and ſo they perſue the Count with two Regiments of foot, ſix hundred horſe, and four ſmall field pieces, and ere they were a ware begirts them cloſe in a ſmall Town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Danfront,</hi> which though a weak Town, yet the Caſtle was well ſeated, inſomuch that they reſolved to ſtand, and dy like Souldiers, with Swords in their hands at a breach, than be ſhamefully murthered, or dy on a Scaffold. At this ſiege by the valour of the Count, and Friends, the Catholicks loſt <hi>St. Colomb,</hi> and a great many Gentlemen Voluntiers, and two hundred of their moſt valiant men; but at laſt no longer able to continue, they yield to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignan,</hi> with theſe tearms, viz. to have their lives, carry away their arms; and yet it was ſo as they were to remain ſometime in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Martignan</hi> and <hi>Vaſſey,</hi> with ſecurity for the Counts life. But was it ever read of in ſuch a ſmall Hiſtory, and in Wars of ſo ſhort time that ever there was ſuch a common breach of faith and promiſe when ſigned and ſealed for a ſtrict obſervance, as a good Author ſays, he that is a baſe ſo, is conſtantly falſe in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The Count being in his Enemies cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yielded to too much cruelty, on terms of mercy; who I dare ſay, had rather died a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deaths like a true Souldier, then be ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delt withal, for in the night he was guarded
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170274:149"/>away Priſoner to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there baſely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the ſight of the King, and Q. Mother, who received much joy at his death; but the juſt God ſaw all theſe treacheries, and juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded ſome according to their bloody deſerts.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude this ſad and dolefull reign of a bloody Tyrant; let us ſee after his blood reign and flatigious life, a ſad and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death, a ſpectacle of Gods anger, and an embleme of his bloody dealing; who falling ſick in the prime of his years, being forced to his Bed, he was ſore tormented and handled with a great effuſion of blood, which iſſued out of all parts of his body; and that which very much aſtoniſhed many, he did once rowl himſelf in hit own blood, vomiting blood through all the Conduits of his body; that it may be ſaid as of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar, Lutum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Maceratum,</hi> a lump of clay ſoaked in blood. So this King by the juſt judgement of God expired his laſt, the 24. year of his age, and in the year of our Lord God 1574. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſacrificing to the Gods, found a Beaſt without a heart, which was looked upon as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ominous; and ſurely may we not infer from this Kings bloody reign, that he <hi>Had no heart, a bloody Heart,</hi> or, <hi>A Heart, and a Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this King, having lived in other mens blood, dyed in his own; which as it was the iſſue of his own deſerts, ſo it was an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of Gods juſtice.</p>
               <p>And it cannot but be taken notice of that the reſt of the chief Agents of this bloody Tragedy were ſtrangly and juſtly cut off. The Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> being then King of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſucceeds this King <hi>Charls,</hi> by being called from
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170274:150"/>
                  <hi>Poland</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Yet God follows him, for by the means of a young <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobine Monck,</hi> named <hi>Fryer Jaques Clement,</hi> the ſaid King was ſtabbed in the ſame Chamber where he held Council for the acting the late Tragedies.</p>
               <p>The juſt hand of God perſued the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was murthered in the Kings own Chamber, five and fourty waiting with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Poinyards to do it.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother with grief broke her heart, and died the firſt of <hi>January</hi> after.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it hath been obſerved by a good Author, that ſince the year of God, 1560. that of a thouſand murtherers which remained unpuniſhed by men, there was not ten eſcaped the Divine hand of God, but came to deſerved and wretched ends, ſuitable to their bloody and butcherly lives.</p>
